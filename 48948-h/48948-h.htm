<br /><span class="small">SIGNS OF COMING TROUBLE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of seeing it raining, and that&rsquo;s a
fact, Hugh. Seems to me it&rsquo;s been pouring
down in bucketfuls for a whole week now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days, to be exact, Billy. The worst
is yet to come, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to explain that conundrum to
me, Hugh, because I don&rsquo;t seem to catch on
to what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop and think what a tremendous lot of
snow fell last winter, Billy. Everybody in Oakvale
said it beat the record. And now they report
that it&rsquo;s started melting at a great rate in
the mountains. And here&rsquo;s the rain and sudden
warm weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a bad combination, for a
fact!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;It might make a serious flood for all the
valley below. As we came along on the train
that brought us here, I noticed the water was
lapping the embankment in a number of places.
I hope they don&rsquo;t have a washout that would
keep us marooned here in Lawrence, and away
from home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy whose name was Billy, and who was
a good-natured looking, stoutly built chap,
dressed, underneath his raincoat, in the khaki
of a scout, whistled and allowed a gleam of additional
interest to sweep across his face as
he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whittaker! That <i>would</i> be an interesting
experience! And Hugh, two members
in good standing of the Wolf Patrol, Oakvale
Troop of Boy Scouts, might find some bully
opportunities for showing what scouts can
do in emergencies. Between you and me I
don&rsquo;t know but what I&rsquo;d be glad of a chance
to be marooned in the flood belt, so as to watch
the circus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two lads were Hugh Hardin and Billy
Worth, whose names have become household
words to such boys as have had the pleasure
of reading previous volumes of this series.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Since there may be new readers who are
making the acquaintance of the lively members
of the famous Wolf Patrol for the first
time, perhaps it would be only fair for us to
turn back a little and say something concerning
Hugh and his friends.</p>
<p>At first, the new movement had not taken
hold in Oakvale with any great speed, so that
the Wolf Patrol composed the entire membership
of the troop. But Hugh Hardin, Billy
Worth, Bud Morgan, Arthur Cameron, and
the other members began to have such a grand
time that more boys evinced an ardent desire
to join.</p>
<p>So another patrol had been started, and the
good work continued from month to month,
until, at the time this story opens, there were
the Hawks under Walter Osborne, the Otters
with Alec Sands as leader, the Fox Patrol in
charge of Don Miller, and a new detachment
to be called the Owls, which Lige Corbley had
recently been organizing.</p>
<p>Besides being the leader of the Wolf Patrol,
Hugh sometimes acted as assistant scout master
in the absence of Lieutenant Denmead, a
retired army officer who gave considerable
time to the boys, for whom he felt sincere affection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>These lads had many times been in camp on
the slopes of Old Stormberg Mountain, near
their native town; and in and upon the clear
waters of the lake they had paddled, fished,
swam, and enjoyed every aquatic sport known
to them.</p>
<p>Many of them were posted in all the valuable
knowledge that a true scout deems essential
to his well-being. Occasions had arisen whereby
certain favored members of the troop had
been enabled to pass through rather remarkable
experiences in other sections of the country.</p>
<p>One of these trips, detailed at length in earlier
volumes, took them to the encampment of
the state militia, where the boys were enabled
to prove their mettle by serving in the Signal
Corps. From the commander they received
many compliments on account of their proficiency
with the flags and in heliograph work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Some of them had even taken a trip to the
Sunny South, visiting the coast region in Florida,
where they found a chance to assist the
Life Saving crew in their work of rescuing
shipwrecked mariners from watery graves.</p>
<p>At another time, they were given the privilege
of being in company with the Naval Reserve
Corps aboard a Government war vessel
at the annual drill. Thus they learned a great
deal more about the means of coast defense
which Uncle Sam has at his disposal than they
could ever have picked up second hand or from
books.</p>
<p>These experiences, and many others that
have been treated in detail in the preceding volumes,
had made seasoned veterans of some of
the Oakvale Scouts. Hugh and Billy in particular
had gone through so many different
adventures that they often had occasion to
wonder what would come along next on the
program.</p>
<p>Their last real exploit had been the cleaning
up of their native town. For the accomplishment
of this useful service they had received
the unstinted thanks of the clubwomen, who
had long wrestled with the problem without
being able, unassisted, to accomplish any reformation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>When the scouts took hold, backed by these
public-spirited women, who proceeded to see
that the ordinances were strictly enforced, a
wonderful change came over the whole community.
Previous to that time, at every windstorm,
the streets were a sight to behold&mdash;filthy
with flying papers and all sorts of trash. But
quickly order came out of chaos, despite the
plottings of a set of mean boys who endeavored
to frustrate the work of renovation.</p>
<p>And now Oakvale was known as a model
town in so far as cleanliness was concerned.
Why, it seemed as though everyone living
there took special pride in keeping up the good
work. If a stranger carelessly happened to
throw away the wrapper from a newspaper he
had taken from the postoffice, the chances were
ten to one half a dozen boys, or even small girls,
in fact, would chase after him to ask him to
please pick it up and deposit it in one of the
big cans marked &ldquo;<span class="small">I EAT TRASH</span>&rdquo; that stood at
convenient corners of the main thoroughfares.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>But when we meet Hugh and his best chum
on the present occasion, they are far removed
from their home town. It came about in this
way, and after all was one of those simple matters
that so frequently arise to throw people
in the way of new and novel experiences.</p>
<p>Hugh&rsquo;s folks had occasion to send a valuable
package to a lawyer who lived in the city of
Lawrence, situated over a hundred miles from
Oakvale. Of course, had they chosen, this
could have been dispatched by express; but it
happened that, in order that he sign papers before
witnesses, a personal interview with the
gentleman was necessary.</p>
<p>So Hugh had been delegated to take the little
journey, for no one doubted his sterling
ability, or that he would accomplish every detail
with scrupulous exactness, since his record
along such lines spoke for itself.</p>
<p>Billy Worth decided to accompany him, pretending
that, with such a valuable paper in his
possession, Hugh needed a guard to keep him
from being held up on the road and robbed.
The truth of the matter was, that Billy just
felt like taking the trip since it was during the
Easter holidays, and he chanced to have money
enough in his savings bank to cover the expenses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>They were on the way to the lawyer&rsquo;s office
while expressing their several opinions, as already
given, with regard to the bad state of
the weather. It was their intention, after the
interview had been accomplished and all details
carried out to the letter, to return home
at once by the first train.</p>
<p>As had happened repeatedly before in their
careers, their well-laid plans were destined to
be rudely upset by circumstances over which
neither of the boys had any control. In playing
them this little trick, a favoring fortune
placed it within their power to witness, and
take part in, some of the most remarkable
scenes of any that had come within the scope
of their experience.</p>
<p>They had never been in the little city of Lawrence
before, but since most of the business
houses were located on the main street they
had little difficulty in finding the offices of the
lawyer to whom Hugh had been sent.</p>
<p>Mr. Jocelyn knew of their coming; indeed,
was expecting their arrival on the eleven-thirty
train. Much of their trip, however, on account
of the threatening waters, had been accomplished
at diminished speed. It was now a
full hour after the set time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The attorney had made all allowances for
the delay, having doubtless called up the station
agent on the &rsquo;phone, and learned just why
the train from the East was so late.</p>
<p>The boys found Mr. Jocelyn waiting for
them and with everything ready, so that the
object of Hugh&rsquo;s journey could be speedily and
successfully carried out.</p>
<p>A half hour afterward the two lads descended
from the office of the lawyer. Hugh felt
his pocket in which he had pinned the precious
document that was the cause of his visit to
Lawrence with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Mr. Jocelyn had apologized for not asking
them to stay to lunch with him. He lived some
miles out of town, and intended to hurry back
home immediately, as he had a sick wife whose
condition gave him much anxiety. Besides,
he lived not very far from the river, and the
rising waters also added to his grave concern.</p>
<p>It was a matter of no consequence whatever
to Hugh and Billy where they ate, so long as
the food was fairly decent, and their money
held out. Accustomed to camp fare, they knew
how to take things as they found them, and
seldom made any complaint; which philosophy,
after all, is one of the finest traits any lad can
have, and one that scouts are apt to have ingrained
into their dispositions after a few
camping tests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get out of here until that two-thirty-seven
train for the East,&rdquo; Hugh was
saying, as they swung along the main street.
The sky overhead was heavy gray, and threatened
to send down another downpour of rain
at any time to add to the misery of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed that there was a pretty good lunch
counter down at the railroad station,&rdquo; remarked
Billy. &ldquo;You see, some of the trains
make a meal stop here at Lawrence. So they
prepare for a rush of custom. I reckon we can
fill up there, and be handy for the train when
it comes along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea, Billy, to hit two birds with
one stone,&rdquo; declared Hugh. &ldquo;While I think
of it, there&rsquo;s another thing we might do at the
same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to pass the postoffice on the way
down to the station, you may remember,&rdquo; said
the patrol leader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I saw where it was,&rdquo; Billy replied.
&ldquo;That habit of noticing things, which scouts
are drilled in, can be made use of by a fellow
everywhere. Nowadays I&rsquo;m always looking to
the right and to the left, and let me tell you it&rsquo;s
mighty few things that escape my eye. But tell
me what the postoffice has to do with our going
back home. You don&rsquo;t think of sending
that paper by mail after all, I hope, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After going to all the trouble I have?&rdquo;
cried the other. &ldquo;Well, I should think not,
Billy. It&rsquo;s a whole lot safer in my pocket than
with the mails, even if I registered the package.
But about the postoffice&mdash;I just happened
to remember that it&rsquo;s a part of the program
daily, at our town, to receive the Government
weather report, and post the same on
the bulletin board. I suppose they do likewise
here in Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see now what you&rsquo;re after,&rdquo; observed
Billy hastily. &ldquo;You think that, with these unusual
conditions hanging over this section of
country, Uncle Sam might get out special flood
reports and predictions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Hugh declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an
idea something like that must have happened,
because when we were passing the postoffice
I could see quite a crowd hanging around,
mostly men; and Billy, they seemed to be talking
in knots, as though discussing something
mighty serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Hugh, that crowd is bigger than ever
now. Look yonder, and you can see how it
stretches out into the street. People are heading
that way, too, from all directions, you notice.
It looks to me as if there is something
doing that has all the earmarks of a tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys turned grave faces toward
each other. Although Billy may have spoken
rather light-heartedly about his desire to witness
a flood, at the same time he could appreciate
something of the horror that always attends
such a catastrophe; and the prospect of
being involved in so sweeping a disaster gave
him a strange thrill in the region of his heart.</p>
<p>They hastened their footsteps. Others were
to be seen running toward the postoffice, and
often stopping to make inquiries of those they
knew. Since the two members of the Wolf Patrol
were absolute strangers in town, they did
not depend on getting their information at
second hand, but pushed their way through the
gathering crowd, until they found themselves
inside the building given over to the service of
the postoffice department.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, over this way!&rdquo; said Hugh,
as he elbowed through the thick mass of humanity,
and on all sides they began to hear
gloomy expressions and forebodings.</p>
<p>There was a paper posted on the wall, which
engaged the attention of the surging throng.
The scouts saw that there was a line or two
of typewriting on it, which they managed to
read with bated breath, and this was what the
notice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavy rains predicted for to-night and to-morrow
all through the Eastern section. Flood
conditions will prevail, possibly to an unprecedented
extent in some quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">STRANDED FAR AWAY FROM HOME.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it, Hugh?&rdquo; asked
Billy, after they had allowed themselves to be
pushed along by the surging, anxious crowd,
and found themselves once more outside the
postoffice building, headed toward the railroad
station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a bad job, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; replied
the patrol leader. &ldquo;You see, the river runs
past Lawrence, and already its bank is full
with the flood, which is rising right along. I
heard one man say it was up to the highest
notch on record. If rain keeps coming, there
is no telling what terrible calamity might hit
all this section of country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to take back something I said without
thinking twice, Hugh. I guess, after all,
a flood isn&rsquo;t anything to laugh at. The look
on the faces of those men and women at the
postoffice gave me a bad feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the scout leader seriously,
&ldquo;they are afraid that a flood will spell ruin for
some of them. Houses may be carried away,
and barns broken into little bits. All sorts of
valuable farm animals are apt to be drowned.
And sometimes even people in the bargain find
themselves marooned in their homes without
food, and expecting to be afloat on the flood at
any minute. No, there&rsquo;s a heap more of tragedy
about a flood than comedy, let me tell you,
Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering about our train, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean whether it can get here or not?
Between you and me, Billy, I&rsquo;d say the chances
were all against us seeing home to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that exclamation &ldquo;Billy the Wolf,&rdquo; as
he was often called by his friends, relapsed
into silence for a brief space of time; but it was
hard for him to keep from expressing the
thoughts that surged through his brain, so
that presently he started once more to say
something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, I&rsquo;ve noticed a few boys in scout
suits around here since we came. One fellow
even gave me the high sign, as though he wanted
to be friendly. I wonder now if they have
an organization, and whether we couldn&rsquo;t get
in touch with the crowd in case we find ourselves
marooned here in the flood time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to the trouble to look that up before
we left home, and I learned that they used
to have a good strong unit here in Lawrence
two years back,&rdquo; Hugh informed him. &ldquo;But
it seems that it&rsquo;s taken to losing its grip on
the boys. They lost the scout master who had
done most of the work of building the troop
up, and ever since things have grown from bad
to worse. Just now they seldom meet, and
seem to lack all the enthusiasm that is necessary
to success in any organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there are boys who still wear the
khaki,&rdquo; declared Billy, &ldquo;and if it happens that
we do find ourselves kept here, we might try
and get them together, so as to organize a relief
corps of scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a bad idea, Billy, and I&rsquo;ll remember
it,&rdquo; declared Hugh. &ldquo;Here we are at
the station, and the next thing to do is to get
a feed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m jolly well ready for a layout, let me
tell you,&rdquo; chuckled Billy. &ldquo;Breakfast at seven,
and it&rsquo;s now nearly one. Think of that for
a record, and never a bite in between&mdash;well,
I did have a couple of apples on the train, three
bananas, and that candy; but those sorts of
things never count with me. Now for a raid
on that lunch counter. When I give my order
watch the waiter run to the door to see how
many more scouts there are coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, Billy was only joking, for the
man at the lunch counter did nothing of the
kind. They were able to make a very respectable
meal, sitting there on the stools provided
for hasty travelers who would possibly bolt a
cup of hot coffee, snatch up a sandwich, and
hurry out, for fear their train might leave
them in the lurch, only to learn they had another
fifteen minutes&rsquo; wait.</p>
<p>When finally even Billy declared he could
not eat anything more, they paid their bill and
sauntered out of the lunchroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a quarter of two,&rdquo; announced Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And our train isn&rsquo;t due until thirty-seven
after,&rdquo; Billy observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we might get some information
from the agent about what chance there is of
its getting through,&rdquo; suggested the patrol
leader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;I kind of dread to put it to the test,&rdquo; Billy
admitted with a shrug of the shoulders. &ldquo;But
I guess the sooner we know the worst the better.
Come along, and let&rsquo;s interview the ticket
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As customary in towns and small cities, the
telegraph operator was also the ticket agent;
although there were express and station representatives.
He seemed to be busily employed
taking and receiving messages, and paid not
the slightest attention to the two scouts as
they came to the window of his booth.</p>
<p>As both Hugh and Billy had studied telegraphy,
and were, in fact, pretty clever operators,
they soon began to try and read the
message as it came clicking over the wires.</p>
<p>The very first words they deciphered gave
them a severe shock, and made them doubly
eager to catch still more, for they were &ldquo;bad
washouts,&rdquo; &ldquo;all trains withdrawn until further
orders!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>It was a troubled face that Billy turned toward
his chum. The agent had left the telegraph
instrument, and was hurrying outside,
without appearing to notice them. He acted
like a man who had a heavy weight on his
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get that part of the message,
Billy?&rdquo; asked Hugh gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be shut up here in Lawrence,
seems like, and marooned.&rdquo; answered the
other. &ldquo;Gosh! It does take the cake what
queer things happen to you and me, Hugh. Of
all the times we might have taken to come over
here, we hit on the one great day Lawrence has
ever known. Looks like we&rsquo;re in the soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as we manage to keep from being
in the flood we shouldn&rsquo;t complain, I take it,&rdquo;
the patrol leader suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s gone to, do you reckon,
Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The agent?&rdquo; queried the second lad. &ldquo;Outside,
to write some sort of notice on the bulletin
board where they announce whether trains
are on time or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see,&rdquo; suggested Billy.</p>
<p>They found that Hugh had hit the right nail
on the head when he hazarded that opinion, for
the agent was just finishing some sort of notice,
using a piece of chalk to write it. Several
other people came hurrying over to learn
what it might be, so that the nucleus of a crowd
quickly gathered there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Just as the boys expected, after having
picked up the shreds of information from the
sounder inside the ticket office, it was an announcement
that was destined to add considerable
gloom to the already sinking hearts of
those who lived in and around Lawrence, the
isolated little flood city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owing to serious washouts above and below
Lawrence, all train service has had to be abandoned
until further notice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; said Billy, rubbing his chin
with thumb and forefinger in a way he had
when pondering over anything. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in it
up to our necks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I hope not&mdash;yet,&rdquo; Hugh told him.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only going to have that wish you made
so recklessly, gratified. After this I&rsquo;d advise
you to think twice before you say things like
that, Billy. But here we are, and the only
thing that worries me is that the folks at home
will be distressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might get a message through still, if the
wires haven&rsquo;t all been carried down with the
embankment. Let&rsquo;s make the try, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>As the suggestion also appealed to the patrol
leader, they once more entered the station.
Fortunately the agent had not taken it upon
himself to shut up shop and go home simply because
there would be no more trains along in
either direction that day. As long as the wires
were working, he would have to stick to his
post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are from Oakvale, and would like to
get a message through if it could be done,&rdquo;
Hugh informed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wires pretty busy with public business,&rdquo; the
agent said. &ldquo;If you write it out, I&rsquo;ll see what
I can do for you. I expect any old time to find
that my last connection has broken down; and
after that we&rsquo;ll get no news, unless they send
it to us by pigeon post or via a&euml;roplane, as all
country roads are flooded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly Hugh wrote a brief message,
telling how they were marooned in the flooded
district, and asking that Billy&rsquo;s folks be informed,
so that they would not be worried over
the non-return of the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I might get that through right now,
as there seems to be a little lull in official business,&rdquo;
the accommodating agent told them, as
though he liked their faces, and rather sympathized
with their predicament of being caught
in such a trap so far away from home.</p>
<p>It turned out that fortune was kind to them,
for they presently heard him sending Hugh&rsquo;s
message. At its conclusion, both lads heaved
sighs of satisfaction. They could endure whatever
might be in store for them with more grit
and a determination not to be dismayed now
that they knew the dear ones at home would
understand the reason of their not turning up.</p>
<p>After paying for the message and thanking
the accommodating agent warmly, Hugh and
Billy hastened outside. They realized they
were due for new and decidedly interesting experiences;
and there was a sort of half-suppressed
excitement in the atmosphere of the
place that was beginning to affect them.</p>
<p>People were getting more aroused every minute.
The report that the trains to the city had
all been stopped by serious washouts was being
circulated in every direction. The boys could
see that it added one more straw to the load
that was being placed upon the backs of these
Lawrence people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them seem to be heading down
toward the river,&rdquo; remarked Billy. &ldquo;So I propose
that we walk that way, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard no opposition from his chum, because
Hugh had just been about to suggest
the same thing himself. Puddles of water lay
in their path almost everywhere; but these received
only scant attention. Beyond lay the
river, and that riveted their gaze immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy smoke! look at it swirling along, and
as yellow as mud!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, who was
a bit addicted to slang, though most of his outcroppings
along that line were of a harmless
character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is on the boom,&rdquo; admitted
Hugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to believe that raging torrent
can be the same little river that in summertime
lazily meanders through this section of country.
It&rsquo;s carrying all sorts of flotsam and jetsam
along now. See, there goes a chicken-coop;
and out further is the trunk of a tree.
Everything movable has to take a place in the
procession when Mr. Flood comes to town.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! see the barn coming, will you?&rdquo; exclaimed
Billy. &ldquo;It can never go under the
bridge, Hugh. When it strikes, the old thing
will rattle all to pieces, I guess. Now watch
what happens. Say, I think those people on
the bridge are taking mighty big chances to
stay there so as to see all that goes on. What
if&mdash;there, now it&rsquo;s going to smash up against
the bridge!... Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as Billy was saying this in a strained
voice, meanwhile clutching the arm of his companion&rsquo;s
raincoat in his excitement, they heard
a crash; and then the barn, already badly
racked by its tribulations while floating on the
flood, went to pieces.</p>
<p>Some of the boys who were eagerly observing
these happenings gave vent to a cheer, as
though they thought it a treat when the unlucky
barn ceased to exist, and the fragments
floated off on the whirling waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! it looked to me like it might be nip
and tuck between the barn and that old bridge,&rdquo;
Billy remarked, as he drew a long breath.
&ldquo;Why, Hugh, I could see it quivering to beat
the band; and honestly one time I even thought
it was going to drop over into the flood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the same thing, Billy,&rdquo; asserted the
other boy quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;What made it act that way, Hugh? Looks
to me as if it ought to be a pretty strong sort
of a bridge, though if the river rises much
more, the water&rsquo;ll come level with the flooring,
and then it&rsquo;s going to be all up with that structure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the water has already weakened
the piers, and if that&rsquo;s the case, it is bound to
affect the span,&rdquo; Hugh explained. &ldquo;Whatever
can the police of this place be thinking of, allowing
foolish people to gather on a shaky
bridge like that? It might topple over at any
minute, and there would be a whole lot of
drownings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, if this was happening over at our
town, I warrant you the scouts would have
something to say before now about that same
thing. Chances are you&rsquo;d have a bunch of
them at work keeping every living soul off the
bridge, and guarding the approaches, so if it
did go down, no one would be lost. It gives
me a cold shiver just to look at all those sillies
out there. Not only boys, but girls, and men
as well. Why, Hugh, I can see several little
tots there that ought to be tied to their mothers&rsquo;
apron strings, instead of being let roam
around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The patrol leader seemed to be just as deeply
affected as Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are scouts, we must remember, Billy;
and it&rsquo;s our duty to save life every time the
chance comes to us,&rdquo; he said, very soberly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re strangers here in Lawrence, but right
now I can see a number of fellows wearing
khaki. Suppose we take a notion to round
them up and tell them it&rsquo;s their solemn duty
to get busy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, count on me to back you up in anything.
By hook or crook, we ought to clear
that shaky bridge before some big tree comes
floating along to knock it so hard that it&rsquo;ll go
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once they had made up their minds to attempt
an enterprise, the two chums never &ldquo;let
the grass grow under their feet&rdquo; until they had
done everything in their power toward accomplishing
the object they had in view. And
when that consisted of trying to save human
life, Hugh Hardin was ready to exert himself
to the utmost, regardless of his personal sacrifices.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Accordingly he and Billy started to find a
couple of the wearers of the khaki suits who
would be likely to listen to their bold proposition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">ON THE TOTTERING BRIDGE.</span></h2>
<p>There must have been a couple of hundred
people, men, women, and children, watching
the raging torrent sweep past. A flood possesses
some sort of wonderful fascination over
most persons, who will stand and gaze and
even shudder, yet be unwilling to turn away.</p>
<p>New things were apt to happen at any time,
as the water crept higher and higher, with the
worst still to come. Upon the heaving bosom
of the raging river, queer floating objects were
to be discovered. Loud shouts, for instance,
greeted the appearance of a hen-coop with a
couple of terrified fowls perched on its roof;
and great was the glee of the thoughtless onlookers
when, at the crash of this strange craft
against the bridge, the chickens with loud
squawks flew to safety, and were pursued and
caught by some of the younger lads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our chance, Hugh,&rdquo; remarked Billy
Worth, soon after they had agreed to try and
scrape up an acquaintance with several of those
who wore the magical khaki of the scouts.
&ldquo;Three of them are jawing away over yonder
as if they had some sort of idea they ought to
be doing <i>something</i>, but couldn&rsquo;t hit on a
scheme. The field is ripe for the sowing,
Hugh. Get busy with that convincing patter
of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried toward the three boys, who,
discovering their presence, awaited the coming
of the strangers in town with looks of both
curiosity and wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdye, fellows,&rdquo; said Hugh, in his pleasant
way, at the same time giving the scout salute,
which all of the others immediately returned.
&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Hugh Hardin, and that
of my friend is Billy Worth. We&rsquo;re from Oakvale,
over here on business, and we find ourselves
marooned because all trains have been
abandoned until further notice. Please introduce
yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the trio of local scouts, who was a
tall, thin chap with an odd squint in his eyes,
but rather a humorous expression in his face,
took it upon himself to do the honors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tipton Lange, commonly called &lsquo;Tip.&rsquo;
This is our bugler, Wash Bradford, who never
gets a chance to blow his own horn any more
since we&rsquo;ve about disbanded the First Lawrence
Troop; and this runt is Teddy McQuade.
When you say you come from Oakvale, do you
mean to tell us you belong to the same troop
that has that celebrated Wolf Patrol we&rsquo;ve been
reading so much about in the papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy Worth involuntarily puffed out his already
full chest a little more on hearing this
remark. So the papers had been printing some
of their exploits, had they? Even in far-off
Lawrence it was known that Oakvale had the
prize troop of the State.</p>
<p>Hugh smiled as he replied to the other&rsquo;s
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew before that our patrol had
become celebrated, though we certainly have
had the good luck to be mixed up in a number
of affairs that helped to broaden our knowledge
of certain things scouts ought to know.
Yes, we are members of that same Wolf Patrol,
it happens.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh Hardin, hey?&rdquo; exclaimed the boy who
had been mentioned as the bugler without a
vocation. &ldquo;Seems to me, Tip, that was the
name of the leader of the Wolf Patrol we read
about. Yes, and I remember Billy Worth, too.
Say, it&rsquo;s fine to meet you both. And I reckon
now you do things over in your town. Shucks!
the bottom&rsquo;s dropped out of the scout movement
in sleepy old Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put a new one in, then, why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
said Hugh eagerly.</p>
<p>Somehow his energy seemed to affect the
other boys. They exchanged hurried glances,
and their faces even lighted up a little with
expectancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What might you mean by that, Comrade
Hardin?&rdquo; asked Tip Lange ponderously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake the town up!&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Show
them what scouts can do when they have half
a chance. They lost faith in you, I take it, because
there may have been jealousy in the
ranks, and quarreling. Get together and astonish
your people here. Make them sit up and
take notice of what you can accomplish. That&rsquo;s
what we had to do over our way, to get to the
top. And now we have our fifth patrol forming,
and Oakvale isn&rsquo;t nearly as big a place as
your town.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Tip Lange drew a long breath, and sighed
dismally as he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice of you to tell us that, Hardin, and
goodness knows we&rsquo;d like to carry out the idea,
but you don&rsquo;t understand how dead a place
Lawrence is these days. Every effort we made
to hold an exhibition turned out a failure. It
begins to look as if this was no scout town.
The boys have lost all heart. I&rsquo;m nearly ready
to throw up the sponge myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s what ails us fellows; we haven&rsquo;t
got the opportunity to distinguish ourselves
that you Wolf Patrol boys ran across,&rdquo; grumbled
Wash Bradford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No opportunity!&rdquo; cried Billy Worth. &ldquo;Oh!
my stars. Take the scales off your eyes, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No opportunity!&rdquo; echoed Hugh, amazed at
the explanation that had been given to account
for the lack of an organization in Lawrence.
&ldquo;Why, I never ran across such a splendid opening
for scouts to make themselves useful as
there is right at this very minute. With your
town threatened by the most terrible flood ever
known, don&rsquo;t you see that you can do dozens
of things to help people in trouble? No opportunity,
when foolish crowds line a quivering
bridge that is likely to go down if a floating
tree crashes against it like that barn did. Oh!
if only you&rsquo;d let us join in with you, we&rsquo;d <i>find
things</i> to do that would make your folks sit up
and take notice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;And from this day on they would cheer a
scout every time they saw one on the street in
his khaki suit,&rdquo; added Billy, with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The three local boys had stood there and
stared as Hugh poured out his words. His
manner was so vehement that they must have
been thrilled through and through. First of
all they turned and looked at each other; then
the expression of amazement on their faces began
to give way to growing interest that quickly
ripened into what began to approach enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wash, Teddy, what say? Sounds good to
me, I tell you! These fellows have got the right
kind of notion. Let&rsquo;s wake Lawrence up; let&rsquo;s
show these people what a scout is worth when
he really tries! Say, Hugh Hardin, and you,
too, Billy Worth, we&rsquo;ll back you up in anything
you&rsquo;ve a mind to try; and here&rsquo;s my hand on
it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>The feeling of exaltation grew by bounds,
it seemed. Both Wash and Teddy followed the
example set by Tip Lange in squeezing the
hands of the boys from Oakvale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see
what we can do to help you out. And first of
all we ought to find some way to clear that
crowd off the bridge. Some of them are reckless,
and others don&rsquo;t seem to realize the danger
they&rsquo;re in. Let&rsquo;s start in by acting as
though we&rsquo;ve had orders from your Chief of
Police, who ought to be here on the spot, but
isn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t let a solitary one stay; and tell
them all there&rsquo;s danger of the bridge going
out at any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Wash Bradford.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep together, so we can crowd off any
who want to put up a kick and stay. Tell us
what to do, Hugh, and we&rsquo;ll be only too glad
to carry it out. I&rsquo;m tickled to death at the idea
of somebody coming to town who&rsquo;s got some
sense and snap about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish we could coax you to stay with us till
we got the old crowd started up again, that&rsquo;s
right!&rdquo; said Teddy McQuade, with sincere admiration
in his manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The five of them started toward the approach
of the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Wallie Cramer on the bridge; he&rsquo;s
one of our bunch, too. Shall I pull him along
with us, Hugh?&rdquo; remarked Tip Lange, as they
drew near the structure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more scouts you can get together, the
better,&rdquo; admitted the patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In union there is strength!&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Billy
wisely.</p>
<p>They pushed along the bridge, and were
thrilled to find that it did actually tremble from
time to time. Hugh also noticed that there was
a slight swaying movement that was dreadfully
suggestive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t clear this old death trap any too
soon, it strikes me,&rdquo; stammered Teddy McQuade,
&ldquo;and I never was much of a swimmer
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t bother you any if so be you
went over into that soup,&rdquo; declared Wash
Bradford, who himself looked a trifle &ldquo;white
about the gills,&rdquo; as Billy would have expressed
it, when gazing down at the foaming flood that
swept just under the flooring of the bridge used
for vehicles and foot passengers, and which
was much lower than the railroad span.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Meanwhile Tip Lange had been hurriedly
speaking with the fourth scout whom he called
Wallie Cramer. Hugh rather liked his looks.
He believed that once he understood what they
had in view this new addition to their number
was likely to prove a valuable ally. He seemed
to have the appearance of a fellow possessed
of nerve and &ldquo;get there&rdquo; qualities.</p>
<p>Apparently whatever Tip Lange told him in
that minute of time must have aroused Wallie
considerably; for he turned on the two Oakvale
scouts and held out his hand to them
without the formality of an introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count on me to back you up, fellows,&rdquo; was
what Wallie Cramer said. &ldquo;I was just thinking
myself that we were silly to take chances on
this tottering old bridge. People can be such
fools. Shall we start yelling that it&rsquo;s going to
go out, and scare the bunch half to death? Any
old thing ought to pass, so long as we accomplish
our object. The end and not the means
is what counts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty straight,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;ll try to shoo them off first. If they won&rsquo;t
go in that way we might try the scare racket.
Just as you say, some people have to be saved
against their will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the six boys in khaki continued on toward
the opposite end of the bridge until they
had passed the last spectator. A number gave
them an idle look as if wondering who the two
strange boys in khaki might be, since they did
not recognize them as belonging to Lawrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, close up, and form a solid line across
the bridge!&rdquo; called out Hugh, for the roar of
the water whirling about the abutments sounded
so loud that it was next to impossible to hear
anything spoken in an ordinary tone.</p>
<p>Some of those who were enjoying the thrilling
sight of the dizzy flood passing under the
flooring of the bridge, on finding that they
were being forced to vacate did so good-naturedly.
Especially was this the case when
they heard some of the scouts saying that the
police had ordered the bridge vacated because
it was liable to be carried away at any minute.
Possibly these parties awakened to the risk
they had been running, and doubtless would
have continued to run only for the fact of the
line of scouts grimly clearing the roadway, and
allowing no one to remain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Now and then some one grumbled and even
threatened. At such times Hugh pushed up
and gave the man, or boy, as the case might be,
to understand that unless he complied with the
order, an arrest would swiftly follow.</p>
<p>The concealed threat answered every time.
Even a pugnacious fellow who had long been
known as the bully of Lawrence, as Hugh afterward
learned, on looking straight into that
calm yet determined face of Hugh Hardin
finally gave his head a little sneering flirt, and
as he shuffled along was heard to mutter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you ain&rsquo;t no Lawrence scout, young
feller. They ain&rsquo;t built like you. But it&rsquo;s so,
an&rsquo; the old bridge <i>is</i> gettin&rsquo; mighty shaky. I&rsquo;m
a-goin&rsquo; because I want to, an&rsquo; not on &rsquo;count of
bein&rsquo; told to skip out, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was perfectly satisfied. Little he
cared why people abandoned the dangerous
span so long as they did do it. And when he
reached the near side with his little company,
and looking back could see that not a single
man, woman, or child remained on the bridge,
he felt that for once the scouts of Lawrence
had accomplished something worth while.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we must stand guard here, so as to
keep it clear!&rdquo; was what Hugh said to his little
band, as they gathered in a group, the Lawrence
fellows looking exceedingly proud, as
though conscious of having done something
worth while at last.</p>
<p>Hardly had they taken up their positions
than the same town bully whom they had influenced
to leave the threatened span, shoved
up in front of Tip Lange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there, you can&rsquo;t go back on the
bridge, Tug Wilson!&rdquo; the scout told him, as
he blocked the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the luck, I tell ye I dropped my belt
out there, an&rsquo; I jest got to git it. Step aside,
Tip Lange, an&rsquo; let me pass!&rdquo; the big overgrown
bully said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody is to be allowed to go on the bridge
again, Tug!&rdquo; urged the Lange boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>At that the bully, not accustomed to having
his actions questioned, and by a town boy at
that, thrust Tip aside with half an effort, and
in another instant was seen hurrying along
the bridge. He even turned, and, looking back,
put out his tongue in a fashion that spoke
louder than words could have done concerning
his feelings.</p>
<p>Billy Worth, always impulsive, was for dashing
after him, and attempting to accomplish
by force what words had failed to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Tip. We&rsquo;ll get him, all right!&rdquo;
he called out, when a hand was clapped on his
shoulder and Hugh shouted in his ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Billy! If he chooses to
take the chances that&rsquo;s no reason you should
follow suit. He may never come back again.
Look, there is the floating tree coming down
with a rush that we feared might strike the
bridge and send it over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy stood in his tracks as though frozen.
He realized in that instant how once more his
impetuous nature had come close to getting
him into a peck of trouble, as had happened on
numerous past occasions.</p>
<p>Yes, there was a huge tree floating in the
midst of a mass of wreckage, the whole making
a terrible ram that, if brought suddenly against
the already weakened bridge, must complete
its downfall. And, apparently unaware of his
danger, Tug Wilson was sauntering carelessly
across the span, conscious only of the fact that
hundreds of eyes must be centered on him just
then.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Voices began to roar out at him. They
were sending all sorts of warnings; but it might
be that the boy took it for granted these were
cheers because of the nerve he was exhibiting;
for he never gave a single glance up-river way
to where that monster floating tree and its attendant
mass of wreckage was bearing down
toward the tottering span of the bridge, with
the force of a great battering ram.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">AN HONOR TO THE WOLF PATROL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be the last of Tug Wilson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got just about one chance in three to skip
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were some of the exclamations that
broke from the boys whom energetic Hugh
Hardin had gathered around him at the approach
to the doomed bridge. Those fellows
saw what a foolhardy thing it was the big
bully of Lawrence had attempted.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter was that Tug had so
long been accustomed to having his way
through force that he could not brook opposition.
He had been furious at himself for having
yielded to the demands of these silly scouts
while on the threatened structure; and tempted
to defy their authority.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The sudden discovery connected with the loss
of his belt had given him a cue; and with the
result that he was now out there on the bridge,
making his way toward the spot where he
could see the object of his search lying on the
planks.</p>
<p>Tug Wilson did not often find himself in the
spotlight. Public opinion in Lawrence had almost
invariably been heavily against him, because
he was on the wrong side of every undertaking.</p>
<p>And so, when he realized that all those
shouts and half cheers were intended for him,
the boy became more reckless than ever. Instead
of making as much haste as possible out
to his belt, snatching the article up, and sprinting
back to safety, he even slackened his pace.</p>
<p>That noisy applause was sweet music to his
ears. He wanted to stretch it out just as long
as he could. Measuring the distance the approaching
floating tree had still to cover, Tug
believed he would have time to accomplish his
errand and even seconds to spare.</p>
<p>He meant to show those weak-kneed Boy
Scouts that there were others who did not know
the meaning of the word fear, even though they
might not wear khaki suits, and boast of medals
and badges galore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, Tug!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to run, and run fast, old boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those were possibly some of his boon companions
shouting at the top of their voices to
him. Tug heard and took notice. He realized
that they were genuinely alarmed for his safety.
That would mean he might be risking too
much; and so Tug did start to running at last.</p>
<p>Most of those who stood ten deep on the
shore only knew the boy as a town nuisance,
who had given them a great deal of trouble in
times past; still just then they were forced to
feel more or less admiration for his reckless
daring. And so they shouted encouragement,
as though they wanted to see him carry his
desperate and foolhardy venture through to a
successful termination.</p>
<p>The drifting mass was now very near.
Many an anxious eye turned toward it, and
mental calculations that were made gave the
boy but scant time to return to safety before
the crash must come.</p>
<p>Tug reached the spot where his belt lay. He
made out to snatch it up, but, in his haste,
managed to drop it again. Of course that only
necessitated another movement, but it broke
into the even tenor of his way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Besides that, in thus bending he seemed to
gauge the coming danger at a more acute angle
than at any previous time. Hugh judged
that something warned Tug he might have
made a slight miscalculation that would cost
him dear unless he mended his ways and increased
his pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s on the jump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, Tug; you&rsquo;ve got to hump yourself,
old man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were shouting at him again, but if
Tug heard he gave no evidence of the fact. He
was keeping one eye turned toward the threatening
danger, which was in truth the worst
thing he could have done, as Hugh might have
warned him, if given the chance.</p>
<p>Tug was running faster, probably, than he
had ever done before in all his adventurous
life. On previous occasions it may have been
some angry farmer who was in pursuit of him
as a trespasser, but now he was racing with
death itself.</p>
<p>The realization of his foolishness must have
pierced his heart, for, despite the violent exertions
he was making, Hugh could see that his
face was very white.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Hugh himself had taken several paces along
the planks of the approach to the bridge. If
any of his companions noticed the action at all,
which is doubtful, as their attention was riveted
on the running Tug, they could hardly
have guessed what was passing through the
mind of the patrol leader.</p>
<p>Suddenly a concerted groan burst from many
lips. No cheer captain at a struggle on the
gridiron between rival college teams could ever
have produced such a concentrated expression
of dismay.</p>
<p>What Hugh had been fearing had actually
happened. Tug, foolishly dividing his attention
between what lay before him and that oncoming
mass of wreckage, had stubbed his toe
on some projecting plank and been thrown
heavily forward.</p>
<p>They heard the crash of his fall. There was
a second or two given up to watching for him
to scramble to his feet and continue his mad
race. Then came another loud groan from the
now awed crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Tug never moved. He must have struck his
head in falling and lost his senses. Apparently
he was now doomed, if, as seemed probable,
the mass of floating material about to come into
collision with the weakened span carried the
bridge down with it.</p>
<p>Then a faint cheer broke forth. It gathered
headway, halted again, and after that kept on
increasing until it seemed to dominate every
other sound.</p>
<p>Billy Worth knew what had happened, for
he had seen Hugh leave the spot he had been
occupying. Like an arrow from the bow Hugh
ran forward, his one design being to seize upon
the senseless Tug, and in some way drag or
carry him to safety before the bridge fell.</p>
<p>There was a gallant object in this bold attempt&mdash;that
of saving life&mdash;whereas with Tug
it had only been entered into so as to indulge
in his willfulness and display contempt for
authority of all kinds.</p>
<p>Billy held his breath. He was never so
frightened in all his life. At first he was
tempted to chase after Hugh, but the realization
that he could give his chum no assistance
whatever, chained him to the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Now the cheering had ceased. Everyone
seemed to be stricken with the same realization
that it was ill-timed, and might serve to distract
the attention of the intended rescuer.
So it happens that in a desperately fought game
on the diamond, or the football field, the mass
of spectators will swing from loud acclaim to
utter silence as if by magic.</p>
<p>They saw Hugh pick up the heavy figure of
the senseless Tug. Why, the boy must be wonderfully
strong to do that, or else given unnatural
powers when facing such a desperate
condition, the crowd probably thought.</p>
<p>Few of those who looked on believed the
brave scout could ever get back in time to
avert a catastrophe. Perhaps those who hoped
for the best were pinning their faith to the fact
that as yet it was not absolutely positive that
the bridge would yield to the pressure of the
impending collision.</p>
<p>It actually looked as though some unseen
power had thrust out a hand to give Hugh the
few additional seconds he required in order to
make good. Some snag, that might have been
a tree-trunk standing upright in the water,
caught the oncoming mass and held it suspended
for just a brief space of time. Then it
overcame the obstacle to its progress and started
once more toward the bridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>That short truce was enough. It enabled
Hugh to drag his burden to where eager hands
seized upon them both. Thus they were drawn
from the approach to the bridge, with every
spectator shrieking his or her approval.</p>
<p>And, while this tumult was going on, the
floating tree and its attendant mass of wreckage
was seen to come against the middle of the
endangered span. The entire fabric trembled,
and gave way. There was a crash that thrilled
every heart, a stupendous shudder, as of keen
regret over parting from old and valued
friends, and with that the bridge vanished into
the maw of the flood.</p>
<p>Where it had stood now lay a horrid gap.
Fragments projected from the opposite shore,
telling where the bridge had once been anchored.
And floating down-stream on the yellow
torrents, were parts of the structure, intermingled
with the wreckage that had been the
means of its dissolution.</p>
<p>Hugh had sank to the ground out of breath
as soon as he realized that he was safely off the
endangered structure. Some of the scouts bore
Tug Wilson away to the nearest house. The
boy had had a close call, and everybody was
talking about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that young chap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a scout, you could see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been a stranger in Lawrence,
then, because I know all our boys, and it wasn&rsquo;t
one of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bravest thing I ever saw done, barring
none!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to get a silver medal for that,
sure thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could Hugh have heard these and many
other remarks that passed from mouth to
mouth among the people on the river bank, he
would have blushed with embarrassment. But
Hugh was not giving one thought to anything
of the sort. He had managed to recover his
breath, and was once more on the move. This
incident of the stricken bridge was now a thing
of the past, and should not engage their attention
any further. The present and the future
had to be looked after; in other words, the
&ldquo;mill will never grind again with the water
that is past.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Hugh found that a great change had taken
place in the scouts of Lawrence. They were
now wide-awake and enthusiastic. Those
shouts of acclaim had acted like magic to
arouse them. All that was necessary now was
for someone to tell them what to do; they needed
a leader, and every boy would be found
willing and eager to do his level best for the
good of the stricken people of the flooded town
and vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show us something you think we ought to
tackle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready for any old job, it doesn&rsquo;t
matter how hard. We&rsquo;re going to show the
Lawrence people that scouts amount to something,
after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! you just bet we are, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh allowed this enthusiasm to grow spontaneously
for a bit. He knew it would assume
additional strength, if not nipped too
soon. When he considered that the right time
had arrived to strike he gathered the little knot
of boys about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then the first thing to be done,&rdquo; was what
Hugh said, &ldquo;is to get as many scouts together
as we can. Scatter around the town, and
wherever you can lay hold of a fellow who belongs
to your crowd, fetch him here. We&rsquo;ll
need all we can get to try out the many things
there are waiting for us to tackle. Will you
do this, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They would have promised him anything
just then, for Hugh had taken the entire lot by
storm. They greatly admired the way in which
he had dashed out to save the foolish Tug
Wilson, who was accounted the worst boy in
town; and Hugh had been aware of that fact
at the time, which in itself impressed Tip and
Wash and the other local scouts as all the more
remarkable.</p>
<p>So there was an immediate scattering, and
the only one left alongside Hugh was his faithful
chum, Billy Worth. That worthy was surveying
Hugh earnestly, and nodding his head
again and again in approval, as he muttered to
himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just knew it would happen that way. I
knew it would be the luckiest day Lawrence
ever saw when <i>you</i> struck town, Hugh Hardin.
And, my word for it, they&rsquo;ll never forget the
handsome way you yanked that loafer of a
Tug Wilson off that bridge. Once more the
honors go to the good old Wolf Patrol, to which
I&rsquo;m proud to say I, too, belong!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">SCOUTS TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
<p>While waiting there for the return of the
envoys sent out to drum up recruits for the
rescue squad, Hugh noticed that there was considerable
excitement down at the edge of the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s doing over yonder, Billy,&rdquo;
he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was watching that bunch,&rdquo; the other scout
replied. &ldquo;As near as I can tell, they&rsquo;re marking
the stage of the water. If only the river
got stationary, or began to fall, it&rsquo;d mean a
whole lot to the people of Lawrence, not to
mention all the farmers up the valley Tip was
telling us about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must look pretty blue, then,&rdquo; observed
Hugh, as they advanced toward the spot, &ldquo;because
nobody seems to want to give even a
whisper of a cheer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>When they pushed into the crowd they found
that an old inhabitant had taken it upon himself
to keep &ldquo;tabs&rdquo; of the rise of the waters.
Perhaps this had been a hobby of the old fellow&rsquo;s
for years, and he was looked on as a
sort of authority when any reference was made
to past floods.</p>
<p>Some of the people must have recognized in
Hugh the boy who had so lately performed
that gallant act. They nudged one another,
and exchanged low remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like a brave one, sure enough.
Just the sort of chap to carry out a rescue. I&rsquo;d
warrant you now that he&rsquo;s done the same several
times&mdash;snatching boys out of holes in the
ice, or getting them ashore when they&rsquo;ve been
taken with cramps in swimming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they say it was him started the movement
to chase everybody off the bridge. Only
for that there might have been some gone
down with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked Tip Lange who he was, and he said
it was a boy named Hugh Hardy, or something
like that, from over in Oakvale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a good thing for Lawrence if
he came here to live. I never felt so much like
kissing a boy in all my life as when I saw
him drag that foolish Tug Wilson off the
dreadful bridge. I only wish my nephew was
built like that brave boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>It was perhaps fortunate that Hugh did not
hear the old maid say this, or even catch the
remarks exchanged between the others. He
had managed to reach the side of the white-haired
old man who was bending over a
marked stick which he had fastened to a post
that stood deep in the yellow water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do the marks show, sir?&rdquo; asked
Hugh.</p>
<p>The old man glanced up at him. Perhaps
he, too, suspected that this manly looking
young chap in the khaki suit and with the raincoat
over his arm was the same boy who had
so recently performed that gallant deed. At
any rate he replied without the least hesitation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now a foot and two inches above the highest
record made in forty years. I know, because
I&rsquo;ve been keeping tally that long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how fast is it rising now?&rdquo; continued
Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;At a terribly rapid pace, I am sorry to tell
you. In the last hour it has come up almost
a foot. There will be great woe and desolation
all through the valley. I feel sorry for
the people living further away from Lawrence.
It is bad enough here; but we are a community,
and no one need suffer while others are able
to lend a helping hand. But the isolated
farmers and the little hamlets will be in desperate
straits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did the old veteran&rsquo;s heart credit, this
concern for others. Hugh, too, was thinking
of those who had no one to lean upon. He
wished some means could be found whereby
he could start out on the flood that ran for
many miles back up the valley, so as to rescue
those helpless ones caught in the sea of
raging waters.</p>
<p>Once again he and Billy went back to the
place where they had promised to wait for
the coming of the local scouts. All the while
Hugh&rsquo;s active brain was trying to lay plans,
although until he knew just what the nature
of their resources might be it was next to impossible
to settle on these definitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes Tip!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, who
had evidently been keeping a watchful lookout
all the while.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s got two others with him, I notice,&rdquo;
added the patrol leader. &ldquo;Strikes me we
haven&rsquo;t run across either of them before,
Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re new ones to me, all right, which
shows that Tip is all to the good, and has
done his part. If the rest can double up, we&rsquo;ll
have a fair-sized bunch to hustle things some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tip pushed toward them. He must have
been telling his companions a lot about Hugh
as they came along, for the eyes of the two
boys were glued upon the stranger continually,
and they shook hands at being hurriedly introduced
as though proud of the privilege of
knowing this energetic comrade from another
town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Wash coming, and he&rsquo;s got the
Smith twins with him, all right!&rdquo; Tip remarked
immediately afterward. &ldquo;That means
four recruits, and more to hear from. We
ought to scare up some sixteen or twenty fellows,
I should think. Used to have more&rsquo;n
three full patrols in this old town; but things
got so bad there were only seven at the last
meeting, and some of them even said they&rsquo;d
be hanged if they&rsquo;d bother coming out to such
a dull affair again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Others of the local scouts now began to
heave in sight. Those who had started forth
with the intention of rounding up others had
certainly exerted themselves to the limit; for
there was hardly a single fellow who failed to
bring back one new addition to the rescue
squad.</p>
<p>They had managed to enthuse the others to
a considerable extent, too, in some way or
other. Possibly that thrilling event of the
bridge had served them all for the purpose.</p>
<p>When Tip announced that the last scout
who had been sent out was now back, and that
they had their full quota on deck, Hugh counted
noses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen of us, all told, fellows!&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;It strikes me that ought to be enough
to do a heap of work. Over in Oakvale we&rsquo;ve
managed to get there when we couldn&rsquo;t count
on more than half this number to do things.
It depends pretty much on the vim you put
into your labor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us what we ought to tackle first, and
then see us dig!&rdquo; one of the newer arrivals
called out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The spirit was spreading fast, just as a trace
of yeast placed in a lump of dough soon impregnates
the entire batch. Those boys who
helped Hugh and Billy clear the bridge realized
how sweet it was to be possessed of a little
authority. Somehow, people had seemed
to respect them, possibly for the first time.
And then that brave act of Hugh Hardin had
won such golden opinions from the citizens that
it was hoped they would cover the whole scout
movement as with a blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you, fellows,&rdquo; Hugh continued
impressively, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s going to be a plenty
to do for all of us&mdash;perhaps much more than
we can manage&mdash;before this flood goes down
again. You&rsquo;ve got a glorious chance to make
good. There never was such a splendid one
for any scouts that I ever heard about. It&rsquo;s
up to you to take advantage of it; and if you
seize the opportunity you can depend on it,
after it&rsquo;s all over, scout reputation will have
soared to top notch in Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Hugh! That&rsquo;s the stuff we
want to hear!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be taking off their hats to you, fellows,&rdquo;
Hugh told them in his impressive way,
&ldquo;and there isn&rsquo;t anything within reason you
might ask for but what the people of this burg
would give it to you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our chance has surely come, boys! Let&rsquo;s
be like the busy little bee, and improve each
shining hour, only there&rsquo;s nothing shining under
that dark sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind if I said a few words to
our fellows, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Tip Lange, who,
although he had not mentioned the fact to his
new-found friends, must have been in some
position of authority in the now nearly defunct
Boy Scout Troop of Lawrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk as much as you want to, Tip,&rdquo; replied
the other, &ldquo;only we must organize our work on
a systematic basis soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Tip waved his arms until all the
fellows had clustered around him. He had
stepped on a box that happened to be lying
nearby. It looked as though some labor agitator
might be about to &ldquo;spout,&rdquo; and try to
get the honest workers to go out on a strike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; began Tip, in his most impressive
tone, &ldquo;this comrade from Oakvale has had a
heap of experience in building up a scout troop.
Some of us have read about what they&rsquo;ve done
over in his town, and let me tell you it all reflects
great credit on Hugh Hardin, assistant
scout master.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Tip; he sure deserves all that
and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still and let Tip do the talking; he&rsquo;s
got something he wants to tell us, don&rsquo;t you
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Tip started in after these remarks had
ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit of good fortune that brought
Hugh Hardin and his chum Billy Worth to
Lawrence just at this time. Only for what he
did at the bridge there might have been a considerable
loss of life, for some of those fools
would have stayed out there till it was too late
to get off. That&rsquo;s a fair sample of the way
Hugh Hardin does things. And, fellows, we
want him to show us how. You can&rsquo;t see his
wings, but all the same I reckon that he&rsquo;s the
good angel that&rsquo;s been sent here to help us out
of the pit we&rsquo;ve been wallowin&rsquo; in so long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Some of the boys must have considered that
Tip was waxing eloquent in delivering this harangue,
for they insisted on giving him a
hearty cheer. When the noise had again subsided,
the orator continued, evidently fully in
sympathy with his subject, because he had
taken a violent liking for Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I want you to make me a promise,
fellows,&rdquo; continued Tip. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only right and
fair that if Hugh stands by us and does all he
can to land the Lawrence Troop back in the
place it once occupied that we ought to carry
out his orders as unhesitatingly as if he were
at the head of our troop. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was unanimous, and given with
a roar of approval that left no doubt in Hugh&rsquo;s
mind about the ability of these Lawrence
scouts to attain their goal if once they could
be given a fair start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Tip. &ldquo;That sounds good
to me. Now, every fellow who faithfully
promises to look up to Hugh Hardin as our
temporary scout master, and to obey his commands
as such, upon his honor as a scout, raise
his right hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked around, and seemingly counted
the hands that went aloft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fourteen, which, with my own, covers
every Lawrence scout present. That makes it
unanimous. I therefore introduce Hugh Hardin
to the boys of this town as the temporary
scout master of the troop. And now, Hugh,
you take things in hand. No yelling, fellows;
we&rsquo;ve got too serious business in hand to
waste our breath that way. Set your jaws
together like you meant to ride roughshod
over every obstacle. That&rsquo;s the way things
are done, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was entirely satisfied. All preliminaries
having now been arranged, he felt that
they could &ldquo;get down to brass tacks,&rdquo; as Billy
called it, without further delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed, to begin with,&rdquo; he remarked to
the eager scouts who clustered around him,
&ldquo;that the lower part of the town is already being
submerged. There are poor people there
who will lose everything unless some one helps
them ferry their bedding and clothes and such
things as the water would ruin to higher
ground. Now, I&rsquo;m going to lay you all off in
batches so you can work better in company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thereupon picked out three boys who
were to be in charge of Wash Bradford, and
another lot whom Teddy McQuade would boss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get hold of any rowboats you can,&rdquo; Hugh
told them. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s impossible make a strong
raft that can be pushed with poles. Then go
down in the part of town that is under water
and do all you can to rescue people and save
their stuff for them. In that way there will
be many to look upon the garb of a scout as
a badge of honor, and always to be considered
a mark for their respect. And keep working
as long as you can stand it. There&rsquo;ll be plenty
for all of us to do, never fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That took about half of their number, or
eight in all. The two detachments hurried
away, conferring as to the best means for carrying
out the part of Hugh&rsquo;s scheme entrusted
to their charge.</p>
<p>One of the parties managed to get hold of
a large rowboat in some fashion. It may have
leaked to some extent, but scouts would know
how to make temporary repairs, and with this
boat they were in a position to move around
and do considerable in the way of helping those
who had been caught by the rising waters in
the homes they had hesitated about deserting
to the mercy of the flood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The other boys were compelled to resort to
a raft; but Teddy McQuade proved to be a
clever manager, once his energies had been
fully aroused; and he remembered where there
would be plenty of just the kind of pine boards
they would need for a dandy raft. Nails and
a hatchet were procured, also some stout
clothes lines to serve as a check should the
current prove too strong for their clumsy
means of passage along the main street that
was now five feet deep in water.</p>
<p>Of course, Hugh did not intend to waste
any time in seeing how these two detachments
carried out their orders. He had other work
to do. There were still nine of them remaining.
These he divided up into three groups
consisting of the same number of members.
Tip Lange and Billy he kept along with him;
for he had a plan in his mind that he meant
to try and put into execution later on.</p>
<p>When the other six had also been dispatched
to start on the work of accomplishing such
things as they could find to do for the unfortunates,
Hugh turned to Tip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about that boat you said you could
get for us, Tip?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come right along, and I&rsquo;ll try and make
good. I had a ride on the same only last summer,
and if only we c&rsquo;n get the owner&rsquo;s consent
to loan her to us, we ought to be able to do a
heap of rescue work. He&rsquo;s some cranky,
though, and mightn&rsquo;t just like to let three boys
handle the launch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! that sounds cheery to me!&rdquo; exclaimed
Billy, who had not known anything
about this before. &ldquo;A motorboat would be
able to get around in this flood all right, I
should think, provided it kept away from that
nasty current of the river. Lead us to the
man who owns such a craft. That&rsquo;s kind of
you, Tip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lawrence boy hurried away, with his
two new friends tagging at his heels. Dodging
in and out of the crowds that were hastening
this way and that, all terribly excited and
wrought up by the prospects of the flood taking
a fearful toll of property if not human
lives, they came after a while to where a cottage
stood, with its grounds running down
toward the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the boathouse, yonder,&rdquo; called Tip
over his shoulder. &ldquo;Mr. Sperry was smart
enough to have it a floating one, so all he has
to do now is to keep changing the ropes that
hold it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hear some one working with the engine
of the launch, seems to me,&rdquo; remarked Billy,
whose hearing was very acute when he was
excited and anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I just glimpsed Mr. Sperry himself
looking out of the window,&rdquo; said Tip
Lange, as if to explain why he did not intend
to alter their course and head toward the floating
boathouse. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lame man, and can&rsquo;t
get around much afoot, so he has an automobile
and a launch to take him. Come along
in with me, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was indeed a mud-splashed motorcar
at the gate as the three lads passed through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his runabout,&rdquo; commented Tip.
&ldquo;Like&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s been down where the crowd
gathered to hear the latest news. I wonder,
now, if he saw the bridge go out, and how you
got Tug Wilson safe ashore, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had hardly knocked on the door when it
was opened. Mr. Sperry was a man with a
red beard, and walked with a crutch and a
cane. Hugh remembered having seen him in
the crowd; for that useful training as a scout
to notice things and impress them on his memory,
whether they seemed worth while or not
at the time, was serving the boy another good
turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Tip quickly announced the reason for their
hurried call. He introduced his two companions,
and the lame man&rsquo;s eye kindled as he
looked at Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to be sure, I&rsquo;d like to do anything I
could to accommodate so brave a lad,&rdquo; he said
breezily, as he laid a hand affectionately on
Hugh&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I saw what you did down
at the bridge; and the people of Lawrence have
good reason to be glad you happened to be marooned
here. But about my boat, I&rsquo;m sorry to
disappoint you. I&rsquo;ve already promised it to
my nephew who&rsquo;s visiting us; he was sick abed,
but insisted on getting out to do something.
He&rsquo;s down there at the boathouse now. You
might ask him to let you go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a bitter disappointment. Still, it
might be worse, and the three boys started in
the direction of the boathouse, Billy muttering
as he went:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing second fiddle isn&rsquo;t according to my
liking, as a rule; but we&rsquo;ll see what we&rsquo;ll see.
Mebbe we might coax him to give up the ship,
or else toss him overboard!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">A LUCKY MEETING.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know this nephew of Mr. Sperry,
and is he a decent sort of fellow?&rdquo; asked Hugh
of Tip Lange, as the three of them started
down the slope toward where the floating boathouse
was moored to a tree, having long since
been pushed far back of its original landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never knew he had a nephew,&rdquo; replied the
other over his shoulder. &ldquo;I reckon he must
have come from some other town, and is only
visiting here. But he would be a poor sport
if he wouldn&rsquo;t ask us to get aboard and help
out. Come on, we&rsquo;ll soon know what&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pushed in through the open door of
the boathouse. The first thing Billy saw was
that the boy bending over, doing some oiling
apparently to the engine of the launch,
wore a faded suit of khaki. He felt like giving
a cheer, his sense of relief was so great.
Instead he simply clutched Hugh by the arm
and pointed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Hugh nodded his head. They could not see
the boy&rsquo;s face, but the sight of that uniform
was certainly pleasant to the patrol leader. He
seemed to feel a sudden surety that the one who
wore it must have subscribed to the rules by
which all scouts are governed, and if so he
could not well refuse to accept them as comrades
in arms.</p>
<p>Tip Lange coughed loudly, which, of course,
was intended to let Mr. Sperry&rsquo;s nephew know
of their presence. At that the stooping boy
raised his head to look.</p>
<p>Hugh could hardly believe his eyes. As for
Billy Worth, he let out a wild whoop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It sure looks
like our chum, Monkey Stallings. Hey! are
you Mr. Sperry&rsquo;s nephew? Well, if this
doesn&rsquo;t beat the Dutch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy whom Billy called by such a queer
name, and who also answered to that of Eben
when at home or in school, was in fact an
Oakvale scout, and a member of the Fox Patrol.
He had only been in Oakvale a comparatively
short time, but being full of enthusiasm
had managed to work his way up to the grade
of a second-class scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>He came by his absurd title honestly enough;
indeed his comrades could not have dubbed him
by any fairer nickname than that of &ldquo;Monkey,&rdquo;
for he was a regular athlete, and could do all
manner of wonderful stunts, from turning flip-flops
to hanging by his toes from the limbs of
trees, walking a tight rope, and in fact everything
that a circus star of the sawdust ring
could do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you here in Lawrence, Hugh; and
Billy, too?&rdquo; he burst out, apparently as much
astonished at seeing them as they had felt at
sight of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here on some business with a lawyer
for my folks, and Billy wanted to keep me company,&rdquo;
explained Hugh. &ldquo;When the trains
were abandoned we found we had to stay over,
so here we are. But I had no idea you had left
Oakvale, Monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;I only had time to catch the train after
my ma asked me to come up and visit Uncle
Henry for the Easter holidays, as he always
thought a heap of me when we all used to live
up in Maine. Then, hang the luck! I hardly
got here before I ate something that doubled
me up like a jackknife, and I&rsquo;ve been sick ever
since. But when he came back a little while
ago and told me how terrible things were getting,
I made up my mind I was going to take
the launch out and see if I couldn&rsquo;t help some
poor folks save their stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what brought us here,&rdquo; declared
Tip Lange, who had witnessed this
meeting of chums with evident delight, since
it smoothed away all their difficulties like
magic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going off with you to assist in
the good work, hear that, Monkey?&rdquo; asserted
Billy, with the manner of a dictator who would
not take no for an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; sang out the Stallings boy,
with a happy grin. &ldquo;Say, having our assistant
scout master along is going to take a load
of responsibility off my poor shoulders, don&rsquo;t
you forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is the engine?&rdquo; asked Hugh, without
noticing the compliment, although Tip Lange
looked toward Billy and nodded his head as
much as to say: &ldquo;I see he&rsquo;s held in just as
high esteem at home as he will be here in Lawrence,
when people stop to think of all he&rsquo;s
done for the place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be in apple-pie shape,&rdquo; replied
Monkey Stallings promptly. &ldquo;I was just giving
her a little more oil when you came. Uncle
keeps her up to the scratch all the time. He&rsquo;d
make a good scout, because he&rsquo;s so particular
about doing things the very best he knows how.
But say, what about this he was telling me of
some stranger in town who wore scout duds
snatching a boy off the bridge when it was just
in the act of being swept away by a driftwood
pack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy chuckled aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess, Monkey?&rdquo; he demanded,
with a knowing wink.</p>
<p>At that the Stallings boy gave a shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was some of Hugh&rsquo;s work, was it?&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;I might have guessed as much.
I thought it smacked of the Wolf Patrol way.
Some other time you&rsquo;ve got to tell me all about
it, Billy, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you, Monkey,&rdquo; replied the other,
as he clambered aboard the launch, and then
looking about him continued: &ldquo;Seems to me
this boat ought to hold quite a raft of people
if pushed. It&rsquo;s the boss thing for the work
we&rsquo;re going to start out on now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle says it has held twenty by crowding,&rdquo;
Stallings assured him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hugh was busy at the engine.
In addition to numerous other qualifications
that made him a good scout with a wide range
of information, Hugh possessed a practical
knowledge of motors that had proved of considerable
value to him on many occasions.</p>
<p>After a little examination of the one which
he now expected to handle, he soon had it
throbbing noisily. When the moorings were
cast off they ran easily out of the boathouse
and upon the broad expanse of water.</p>
<p>The flood was constantly widening its sweep
as it sought out new places for invasion. There
was a perceptible current nearly everywhere,
though, of course, it was fiercest in the original
river bed, where the sweeping waters met
with no obstructions to their progress, now
that the passenger bridge had been carried off.</p>
<p>Hugh immediately turned toward the lower
part of the town. They could see some people
along the shore waving to them and shouting,
but what they said none of those aboard the
motorboat understood, nor could they take the
time to try and find out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Hugh was very careful how he steered his
boat, for there were snags to be met with, and
should they strike one while going at such
speed, it might prove the finish of the <i>Idler</i>, as
the boat was named.</p>
<p>They could see that there was a considerable
bustle about this section of the town. The
poor folks living here were doing all in their
limited power to save some of their scanty but
nevertheless precious belongings. They were
wading hip deep in the cold water in some
cases, bearing beds, clothes, and one even had
a small cook stove thus elevated.</p>
<p>Others were trying to make excuses for
rafts out of any stray pieces of lumber they
could get their hands on. In most cases these
were so flimsily patched together that there was
a strong likelihood of their parting as soon
as any sort of a load had been placed on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yap-yap-yap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! that sounds like the Otter signal!&rdquo;
exclaimed Billy Worth, pricking up his ears;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Alec Sands and Buck Winter give
it many a time. But we&rsquo;re in Lawrence, not
Oakvale, it happens.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;But they may have had an Otter Patrol in
their troop; how about that, Tip?&rdquo; remarked
Hugh, still guiding the launch with the dexterous
hand of a born pilot, and at the same
time keeping one eye on the throbbing motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure we have, and Wash Bradford
is the leader of the Otters,&rdquo; came the prompt
reply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a boat right now; and yes,
that&rsquo;s Wash himself loading it with some
household stuff the others are passing out of
that window to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s beckoning to us,&rdquo; said Stallings. &ldquo;You
can work in closer to them, can&rsquo;t you, Hugh?
It might be he wants to put us wise to something
of importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble getting there with this boat, if
only there&rsquo;s enough water,&rdquo; the steersman answered,
with a confidence that he believed was
not going to be misplaced. &ldquo;Billy, you&rsquo;re up
in the bow, so suppose you take that pole and
keep finding what the depth is. Sing out to
me as often as you dip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But gee whittaker, Hugh! I don&rsquo;t know
what a fathom is,&rdquo; protested Billy, although he
did snatch up the push pole indicated, and commenced
dipping it straight down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then go by feet, so long as you tell me of
any shoaling,&rdquo; explained Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three feet, then. Now two and three-quarters.
Going at two and three-quarters.
Two and a half! Are you all done? Oh! Two
and a quarter, and sold to the gentleman over
there. How&rsquo;s this, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in close enough, and I&rsquo;ll try to hold
her here against the current while Tip has a
confab with his comrade,&rdquo; announced the pilot,
who wished to let the local boys have all the say
possible in the management of things, so that
they might feel the responsibility that rested on
their shoulders, and at the same time reap the
full reward that was to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Wash?&rdquo; asked Tip, flushing
with pleasure when he heard Hugh designate
him as the one to do the talking, when some
fellows would have monopolized all rights to
that themselves; and it increased his respect
for the visiting comrade more than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting on hunky-dory here, Tip,&rdquo;
replied the leader of the boat party, as he took
a package of bed clothes from one of the other
scouts who appeared at the open window just
then and deposited it in the stern of the craft,
where a woman and three children were huddled,
looking the picture of despair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t want any help, I take it?&rdquo;
questioned Tip Lange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that we know of, Tip. But this woman
says her sister must be in a terribly bad way.
She lives in a tumble-down shanty of a house
around the next corner, that must be a heap
deeper in the water than this one is. If it
hasn&rsquo;t floated away before now it&rsquo;s apt to go
any old time. The current is too swift for us
to hold our own with oars, and besides, this
is such a heavy boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you want us to try for it, do you,
Wash?&rdquo; demanded Tip. &ldquo;How about it, Commodore?
Will the launch stand out against
that current?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; replied Hugh, and then, turning
to Wash, he continued: &ldquo;Did you say it
was around that corner, and to the left toward
the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wash looked at the woman, who had been
listening to this talk while wringing her hands
in anguish. She eagerly nodded her head and
exclaimed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, it is that way, Mister. She&rsquo;s got
three childer, too, and her man he is working
on the railroad plenty miles away. Please get
them safe; and do not forget to bring the bed
clothes, too. The childer freeze without some
covers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waved both hands distractedly, as
though beseeching them to hurry. Indeed,
with that terrible current growing more and
more violent with the passage of time, as the
flood kept on rising, there was indeed much
need for haste. And some of the flimsily built
dwellings of the poorer classes in the manufacturing
town of Lawrence had already
washed away, the boys had heard, being carried
off piecemeal by the greedy waters.</p>
<p>Hugh did not linger. All they had to do
was to back away until the boat could be
turned, and then manage to round the designated
corner. They would very likely discover
the house where the woman and the three &ldquo;childer&rdquo;
lived, and who had been trapped by the
flood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Once they cleared the sheltering wall the
full force of the speeding current struck them,
so that Hugh found it absolutely necessary to
put the little three-horse engine to its best
&ldquo;licks&rdquo; in order to make headway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the house!&rdquo; cried Billy, on the lookout.
&ldquo;There are youngsters in the upper windows
waving bits of white rag to us. We&rsquo;ve
got to hurry, boys, or we&rsquo;ll be too late after
all. That old shanty is ready to go to pieces
right now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">THE HELPING HAND.</span></h2>
<p>All of the scouts could see that what Billy
said was the actual truth. Somehow the water
made through this street with considerable
more force than the one they had just come
from, where Wash and his set were as busy as
beavers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at it sway, would you?&rdquo; exclaimed
Monkey Stallings, a note of genuine anxiety
showing in his quivering voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what would we do if it rolled over,
with those poor children inside?&rdquo; Billy was
saying, as though trying to get his wits centered
on the critical situation, so that he might
be quick to act in case such a dreadful emergency
arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it!&rdquo; cried Tip Lange, who
was looking rather peaked and white himself,
if the truth must be told, though he tried very
hard to force a smile smacking of confidence
on his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can we make it, do you think, Hugh?&rdquo;
Billy continued. &ldquo;Is the engine powerful
enough to knock up against the old current
here? It&rsquo;s just like the sluiceway of a mill. It
comes down through the street so fierce and
wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no trouble about that part of it,&rdquo; the
pilot assured him. &ldquo;What I have to look out
for is to keep away from the lower side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; Monkey observed
sagaciously. &ldquo;If the building should go over
it would be a bad thing for us to get caught.
That&rsquo;s why you want to keep away from the
lower side, Hugh, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh did not bother answering. He had
his hands full with managing the boat, for that
current made its course rather erratic.</p>
<p>Gradually they were drawing around the end
of the old building. Up in the window the children
could be seen. They no longer waved
white bits of rag to attract the attention of
those in the launch. Instead, they acted as
though alarmed, because it must have seemed
to them that the rescue boat meant to pass by
and leave them to the mercy of the raging
flood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Their cries were pitiful. Billy could not
stand it, so he cupped his hands in order to
make his voice carry above all the other sounds,
and shouted words of encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid there, we&rsquo;re not going to
leave you! But it&rsquo;s necessary for us to come
around on the side of the house, don&rsquo;t you see?
Move around with us and get ready to come
aboard. We&rsquo;ll get you safe ashore all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They must have understood from his words
and encouraging signs what he meant, for their
agonized cries ceased, though they continued
to watch the progress of the launch with an
eagerness that might easily be excused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess now that if any of us happened to
be in that shaky old trap, expecting it to roll
over any minute, we&rsquo;d feel scared pretty bad,
too,&rdquo; remarked Tip Lange, as if he thought it
his duty to make apologies for the fright of the
helpless inmates.</p>
<p>With the three &ldquo;childer&rdquo; was the poor
mother, who had seemed just as badly alarmed
as her crying brood, though she had not called
out to the approaching rescuers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Hugh saw that his chance had come. He
proceeded to lay the launch alongside the building
in such a way that he could keep the propeller
constantly moving, and thus be in a
state of preparedness, so that should the house
give signs of toppling over, it would be possible
for them to escape a catastrophe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to stick to my engine, boys,&rdquo; Hugh
told them. &ldquo;So you must do the work. First
thing is to get all of them aboard. After that
we can try to save a part of their things, particularly
clothes and bed coverings. Get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the others answered in the affirmative.
Every fellow had his teeth set, and grim determination
could be seen in their eyes as they
prepared to cheat the flood out of its prospective
victims.</p>
<p>Hugh calculated to a nicety when he brought
the boat against the quivering wall of the
doomed dwelling. The three children filled the
window just alongside, and the eager mother
crouched further back, bent on seeing them
safe before she would think of leaving. That
was the mother spirit every time, Billy Worth
told himself, sacrificing her own chances for
the sake of those she loved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; he cried, as standing there
he held out his hands toward the almost wild
youngsters. &ldquo;One at a time, now, and don&rsquo;t
crowd so. Give me the smallest first, the baby!
There. Now the next one, and plenty of time
for all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Billy said this, he was not quite so
sure of it in his own mind, for he could see the
building swaying back and forth in a terrifying
manner, and did not know but that it might
be lifted off its foundations at the next surge.</p>
<p>He succeeded in placing the three children
safely in the launch. Then only would the relieved
mother consent to clamber through the
open window and join her little family in the
rocking boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we try for some of their stuff,
Hugh?&rdquo; asked Monkey Stallings, who, being
as agile as the animal after which he had been
named, was better fitted for climbing into the
house and taking chances with its upsetting
than possibly any of his mates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but make quick work of it, and if you
do go down, get free from the wreck as fast
as you can. We&rsquo;ll stand by to pick you up,&rdquo;
Hugh told him, though he was himself a little
dubious about the wisdom of such a course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Count on me with you there,&rdquo; said Tip
Lange firmly. He did not mean that all the
credit of this rescue should pass from the local
troop. If they were to receive the praise that
would come later on, they must merit it to some
degree.</p>
<p>So the two agile scouts clambered through
the window one after the other. It was anything
but a pleasant sensation they experienced
when the house gave an additionally severe
roll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going!&rdquo; whooped Monkey; but as the
threatened catastrophe failed to come about he
managed to recover himself; and presently they
became partly used to that strange sensation
which in the beginning had almost made them
seasick.</p>
<p>A hurried hunt was made for clothes. Fortunately
the woman had gathered these together
some time before, when meaning to try
and escape from the house, but being deterred
when she found that the water was already
over the head of her youngest child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Garments of various kinds, such as poor people
might possess, together with a bundle of
bed quilts that took the place of more expensive
blankets lay handy to the scouts. These
the boys quickly seized upon and dumped
through the window, being cautious enough to
make sure that the boat still rubbed against
the side of the building in the same place they
had left it.</p>
<p>Altogether Monkey and Tip were possibly
not in there more than three minutes, if that
long. And, although neither of them said so,
it was apparent from the haste with which
they clambered out again that both felt considerable
relief in being able to leave in good
shape.</p>
<p>Hugh saw that it was the height of folly to
linger another second, now that they had accomplished
all they meant to undertake. Accordingly
he put on more speed, and with the
others pushing away from the house they
quickly left it astern.</p>
<p>The rescued children were all staring at their
late home. Humble though it may have been,
still they must have cherished feelings of affection
for the roof that had lately sheltered
them.</p>
<p>All at once they uttered a concerted cry as
of terror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;There she goes!&rdquo; called out Billy, almost
in awe; and as Hugh glanced toward the house
they had just left he was in time to see it roll
completely over, and then float down with the
swirling current to become its plaything until
finally it would go to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we didn&rsquo;t get out of there any too
soon, seems like!&rdquo; said Tip Lange, not a vestige
of color in his face, as he turned to stare at
his new-found friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to be here instead of swimming
out yonder,&rdquo; commented Monkey dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we couldn&rsquo;t manage to find an open
window quick enough, think of what a time
we&rsquo;d be having in there!&rdquo; added the Lawrence
scout. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s be thankful it didn&rsquo;t happen
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Wolf Patrol fellows,&rdquo; said Billy
Worth, &ldquo;have noticed that when things get to
looking dark for us there&rsquo;s always a quick
change for the better. We call it Wolf luck,
and seems like we&rsquo;ve even come to look for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I only hope it&rsquo;s as catching as the
measles, and that you&rsquo;ve given it to me,&rdquo; Tip
told him, &ldquo;so that after this our troop will meet
a favoring current. It&rsquo;s easy to move along
when everything seems to be going your way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The next thing was to get the woman and
her children safely ashore. Hugh picked out
a place where he thought it would be best to
land them. In doing this he bore in mind the
fact that she had relatives who were being assisted
by Wash Bradford and his squad.</p>
<p>In the end it was managed so that they all
came together on high ground, where they
could find some sort of shelter in case the rain
started coming down again, as seemed likely
to happen at any minute.</p>
<p>Once more the launch was ready to start
out on its mission of mercy, with the four
scouts as eager as ever to do all they could to
help the unfortunate victims of the great flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had half a chance, and the stuff along,&rdquo;
ventured Billy, &ldquo;do you know what I&rsquo;d do,
fellows? Why, make a flag of white, with a
red cross in the center. If this isn&rsquo;t the sort
of relief work those people do then I miss my
guess. But since I&rsquo;ve only got a handkerchief,
and nary a speck of red cloth along, I&rsquo;ll have
to let it pass. Hugh, there&rsquo;s a gentleman beckoning
to you over there. I wonder what he
can want.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know who he is,&rdquo; said Tip Lange.
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s Mr. Hungerford, the mayor of
our town, and a mighty fine man at that. Better
run in and see what he wants, Hugh, if you
think best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will,&rdquo; was the immediate reply
of the pilot, as he changed the course of the
launch until they came close to where the gentleman
stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do for you, Mr. Hungerford?&rdquo;
called out Tip, thinking that as he knew
the mayor he ought to take it upon himself to
interrogate him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Boy Scouts are covering yourselves
with honor and glory to-day, I want to tell you
in the first place,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;Lawrence
isn&rsquo;t going to forget it, either, understand.
I saw you landing that family, and the
other boys in the boat doing just as well. Besides
I&rsquo;ve watched some of your crowd working
a raft through one of the quieter streets to
load up with people or goods. But I believe
we can now take pretty good care of all those
in danger in the town. With your means for
getting around it would be a splendid thing,
boys, if you started up the flooded valley to see
what good you could do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, we were just meaning to do that,&rdquo;
Hugh assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say so,&rdquo; said the
mayor, a little of the worried look on his face
disappearing. &ldquo;Reports have been brought in
that they are having a truly terrible time of it
all along up there; and I am sure you will find
dozens of things you can do to save life and
property. God bless you, boys! Lawrence is
proud of her sons this day. Now, make all
reasonable haste, and play your part in this
terrible drama that has been thrust upon us.
Good-by, and the best of luck to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waved their hats, and gave the mayor
a parting cheer as Hugh started the throbbing
motor on at full speed. And it can be readily
asserted that Tip Lange&rsquo;s heart was swelling
with a song of thanksgiving in that he believed
the scouts of Lawrence had at last been afforded
a glorious chance to come into their
own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">THE DAWN OF THE SCOUTS&rsquo; DAY.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! did you ever see such a sight as that?&rdquo;
cried Tip Lange, after they had presently
turned into the section that lay back of Lawrence.</p>
<p>No wonder the boy was amazed and almost
terrified. It was a spectacle calculated to make
any one rub eyes, and wonder whether it was
not all a dream.</p>
<p>All his life Tip Lange, living in the town of
Lawrence, had been accustomed to seeing that
broad and fertile valley green with growing
crops and grass and trees in the summer, or
covered with a white mantle of snow when the
season changed. But now it lay there a tremendous
inland sea, water everywhere, with
bunches of trees, or it might be farmhouses
and barns, visible in various quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Fences were mostly far under the surface.
Some people were paddling around on hastily
constructed rafts, and trying desperately to
save a small portion of their personal property.
A few boats were also in evidence, but these
seemed to be leaky, and of little value so far
as doing the work of rescue went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it must be all of two miles across
from hill to hill!&rdquo; declared Billy, as he stared
in awe at the wonderful sight, and began to
realize more than ever the majesty of such an
amazing flood, backing up into the valleys, and
inundating a thousand homes and farms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who were wise got to the hills long
ago, I reckon,&rdquo; Monkey Stallings ventured to
say, as they began to push along swiftly
through this inland sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let&rsquo;s hope that covers most of the people
living in the valley,&rdquo; Hugh added. &ldquo;There
are always some who will not believe things
can be as bad as they seem to their neighbors;
or who hate to leave their property so much
that they take the risk of staying. Those are
the kind we&rsquo;ve got to find and help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope we can do it all before night
comes along,&rdquo; said Tip, &ldquo;because if the water
keeps on rising it will be a terrible night for
anybody stranded in a farmhouse, with the
rain beating down, and mebbe the wind blowing
great guns, for they say there&rsquo;s another
furious storm headed this way, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do first, Hugh?&rdquo; asked
Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m depending on you fellows to use your
eyes and tell me if you can see a white flag
of distress waving in any direction,&rdquo; the pilot
replied. &ldquo;It would seem that if people wanted
to be taken off they&rsquo;d have the sense to rig up
some sort of a signal of distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, over there, those people in that boat
are waving to us now!&rdquo; cried Monkey Stallings.
&ldquo;They seem to be baling out at a crazy
rate, and I guess the old ship is threatening to
sink under &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh instantly changed his course, and
headed for the foundering boat. Those who
were aboard the craft did not cease their efforts
to keep afloat, and doubtless watched the
approaching launch with anxious eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Fortunately there was no catastrophe, and in
good time the scouts had the chance to rescue
them. It turned out that they were an old
couple, badly frightened when one of their oars
broke, and they found that the leaking boat
threatened to go down with them, far from
land.</p>
<p>They had quite a quantity of stuff aboard,
and seemed to set such store by it that the boys
could not refuse to save it. Already the boat
was filling with water since no further effort
was being made to keep it down; and before
long it would be almost level with the gunwale,
when it might drift about in that condition.</p>
<p>Hugh decided that it would be a waste of
time to try and land the fugitives of the flood
as fast as they were rescued. They could be
kept aboard until their number had increased
to a respectable figure, when the run to the
nearest shore would be undertaken.</p>
<p>Hardly had they again started on than Tip
gave notice that he had sighted another signal
of distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had marine glasses along,&rdquo; he
said, after directing Hugh how to point the
boat&rsquo;s nose, &ldquo;then I could tell what that means.
Seems to me somebody must be swimming, and
waving a handkerchief or something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think you&rsquo;re wrong there, Tip,&rdquo; Billy
observed, after he had stared intently at the
object ahead, while Monkey Stallings continued
to wave a piece of white cloth he had picked
up, so as to assure the imperiled ones their
signal had been seen. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to
be moving at all. P&rsquo;raps they&rsquo;re sitting on
some sort of raft, low down near the surface of
the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the launch was making pretty good time,
of course the scouts rapidly approached closer
to the object of their curiosity. Many were
the guesses they continued to make in trying
to solve the mystery.</p>
<p>Finally it was determined that those they
were drawing near must be standing on some
rock or mound, for there was no sign of a
farmhouse near them.</p>
<p>This proved to be the actual case. There
were seven in the party, a man, his wife, and
five children. They had started to wade from
their farmhouse to the hills, thinking it could
be done; but the water kept on getting deeper
and deeper until they became frightened and
dared proceed no further.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>When they turned to go back, the sight of
all that wide sweep of agitated water appalled
them; so they had clung to the little rise of
ground they had accidentally struck, hoping
and praying that some boat or raft would come
to their assistance.</p>
<p>They were a thankful crowd when the scouts
managed to get them all aboard; and a dripping
one into the bargain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to get ashore now, Hugh,&rdquo;
remarked Billy, after the last of the seven had
been helped into the launch, this being the
father of the family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re shivering as it is, and will
soon take severe colds in this raw air,&rdquo; decided
the pilot of the expedition, as he started the
engine, and headed straight toward a point
which he had already picked out as the best
place for the fugitives to be landed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see to it that they have a jolly big
fire going before we leave them,&rdquo; Billy continued;
for he was very fond of a fire himself,
and believed that it was likely to be a solid
comfort to shipwrecked people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; commented the patrol
leader, who knew he could leave all that sort
of things to his chum, for Billy was a great
hand to look out for the material side of things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>As they drew nearer the point they found
that there were already people there, who may
have reached there by wading through the water
when it was not so high; or else by boat or
raft. At any rate there seemed to be quite a
number of them, watching the approach of the
launch with the intense interest that forlorn
fugitives, chased out of their homes by a flood,
always show in newcomers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And think of them not even having the
sense to get a roaring fire going,&rdquo; remarked
Billy, &ldquo;with all that good fuel around them,
too! Well, some folks hardly know enough to
come in out of the rain. If this scout business
is doing one thing for the boys of America,
it&rsquo;s teaching them to use their brains and do
things. The next generation isn&rsquo;t going to be
near as helpless as this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a log leading out into the water,
Hugh!&rdquo; cried Monkey Stallings. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t
want to ask for a better place to run alongside.
We can get our cargo over the side in
great shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently Hugh thought likewise, for he
at once aimed to draw up by the log. It proved
all that the Stallings boy had prophesied, and
as some of the scouts began to assist their
passengers ashore the load was soon lightened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Then while Tip and Hugh and Monkey began
to carry the bundles with them, Billy cast
around for a suitable place in which to build
the fire he contemplated starting. Undoubtedly
those hapless people would have good cause to
remember the khaki of a scout with feelings
of gratitude; and in the future it was going
to be reckoned a badge of honor indeed for
any fellow around Lawrence to be wearing
such a suit.</p>
<p>Billy exercised his knowledge of such things
to start his blaze in a place where it would burn
best with that wind prevailing. He interested
some of the children in the task of dragging
plenty of fuel forward, so that in a very short
time he had a jolly blaze leaping upward.</p>
<p>It was wonderful what a difference that fire
made in the feelings of those stranded people.
Why, with the coming of its genial warmth and
glow, the look of woful anxiety began to leave
their faces. They gathered around, held out
their hands to the fire, and even started talking
hopefully concerning the future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Those who had been standing in the water
up to their waists, and whom the cool air had
caused to shiver, now began to steam as they
sat to the leeward of the fire, regardless of
what smoke blew in their faces, so long as they
could feel comfortable again.</p>
<p>Billy was not yet satisfied. It might start
raining at any time, and unless some sort of
temporary shelter were provided, these people
would soon be wet to the skin.</p>
<p>Accordingly he showed the men how a scout
would make a shelter out of boughs if he found
himself overtaken by night in the woods.
While this might not answer as well as a tent,
at the same time, if properly made, it would
shed most of the rain, and with the aid of the
fire tend to keep them fairly comfortable until
they knew what next to do.</p>
<p>Help would of course come from the good
people who happened to live on the higher
ground, and who might be depended on to see
to it that these unfortunates at least did not
starve. When the raging waters went down,
and the river shrank back into its normal bed,
they would once more take up the task of trying
to restore their ruined homes in the great
level valley, once so prosperous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Much as the scouts would have liked to have
stayed longer, so as to help still further, they
felt that they owed it to other victims of the
flood that they get busy again. These were
only a small fraction of the valley sufferers,
and could not expect to monopolize the time of
those who had the launch, possibly the only
power boat in all that vicinity.</p>
<p>From the way in which Hugh started off,
Billy Worth determined that he must have
some settled plan in his mind, although nothing
had been spoken with regard to it.</p>
<p>He looked beyond the boat&rsquo;s bow, and while
far away he could see what seemed to be farm
buildings, nothing in the way of a fluttering
signal of distress caught his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still Hugh knows what he&rsquo;s doing, never
fear,&rdquo; Billy told himself, because he had had
many a practical demonstration along these
lines, and felt unlimited confidence in his superior.</p>
<p>His curiosity continued to grow the closer
they came to the abandoned farm buildings,
until finally Billy could hold in no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re meaning to do
something, I take it, at that place, because
you&rsquo;ve headed straight this way from the time
we left shore; but look as hard as I can I&rsquo;ve
failed to see a sign of life about the farmhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Hugh smiled, because he had been anticipating
some such remark, having noticed the uneasy
movements and puzzled looks of his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where one of the men ashore lives,&rdquo;
he started to explain. &ldquo;He was speaking to me
about it, and begged me as a favor to come
out here right away on an errand of mercy.
They were away from home when the flood
came, you see, and couldn&rsquo;t get back here to do
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he want you to do for him?
Was there any one left at home? Does he
expect us to salvage some of his best furniture
and clothes for him, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither one nor the other, Billy. The fact
of the matter is he wants me to do something
to save a pair of valuable work horses that are
shut up in the lower part of his stable, where
they may drown there in their stalls if the
flood rises a couple of feet more!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">GATHERING THEM IN.</span></h2>
<p>Now, as Billy loved horses, he was ready to
applaud the plan suggested by Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought to be easy to open the door of the
stable,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Like as not the horses
have broken loose from their mangers long
before now, with the place filling with water
and giving them a scare. But if they haven&rsquo;t,
why I&rsquo;ll guarantee to get in there some way
and cut them free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the stable yonder,&rdquo; called out
Stallings, who had heard what was passing
between his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Hugh assented, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s got a stone basement,
he told me, which would be apt to hold
out for quite some time against the water, because
there&rsquo;s little current up here, and only
the sweep of the wind to fear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The launch was steered so as to come up
alongside that part of the stable where they
could see the door was situated. This was
now half under water, and if found to be
locked Hugh would have to use the key the
farmer had thought to put in his hand before
they left the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First time a boat ever called at their door,
I bet you!&rdquo; said Tip. &ldquo;I know the folks, and
have been here at their place more than once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and Monkey Stallings held the launch
steady while Billy tried the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked, Hugh, and here&rsquo;s the padlock six
inches under water,&rdquo; he remarked, in a disgusted
tone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to try and break in,
I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, take this key the owner gave me,&rdquo;
Hugh explained. &ldquo;Be careful not to let it slip
out of your grip, or we will be in a hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy promised to be cautious, and after a
little fumbling managed to undo the big padlock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and we&rsquo;ll get the boat out of the way
so the door can be drawn back,&rdquo; Tip Lange
told him. &ldquo;Then the poor animals can wade
or swim out as they please, if it happens they&rsquo;re
loose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>A number of whinnies had come from inside
the stable, showing that the imprisoned
horses recognized the presence of human beings,
and perhaps understood that a way would
be opened for their exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hear them thrashing about a good
deal,&rdquo; Monkey announced, &ldquo;which I would take
to mean they might be free from their halters
and hitching ropes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy maintained his grip on the door, and
as the others pushed the launch slowly along
an opening began to appear. Hardly had the
door swung halfway open before a horse&rsquo;s head
appeared in sight, and out came an animal,
swimming like a muskrat, only its head, neck,
and a small portion of its back being visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the second old chap, all right!&rdquo;
exclaimed Billy, as another head followed the
tail of the first horse. &ldquo;Did he say there were
only two of them, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the extent of the misery here,&rdquo; came
the prompt reply. &ldquo;But look over yonder, will
you, at the chickens perched on that coop; yes,
and turkeys, too. Poor things, they&rsquo;re apt to
be pretty hungry before they get a meal again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what&rsquo;s that swimming around over
there?&rdquo; demanded Tip. &ldquo;I do believe it&rsquo;s a
dog; yes, and Farmer Jones did have a fine
watch dog. I remember he had him chained
to a kennel somewhere about there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t pass by without trying to give the
poor fellow a chance for his life,&rdquo; Hugh declared,
as he headed toward the spot where the
moving object had been observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sees us now,&rdquo; said Tip. &ldquo;But, say, the
poor fellow is so rank tired swimming that
he just can&rsquo;t give even a yelp, let alone a joyful
bark. Chances are he sat on top of his
kennel till the water got so deep he had to
swim; and as he&rsquo;s fastened with a chain he&rsquo;d
soon have been drowned if we hadn&rsquo;t come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they came up to the dog Tip spoke
kindly to him, calling him Carlo. Then he
took hold and managed in some way to unfasten
the animal&rsquo;s collar. Of course this freed
Carlo from the detaining chain that had come
very near being his death. Tip and Monkey
Stallings assisted the big dog to clamber over
the side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>The very first thing Carlo did was to scatter
showers of drops all around him, which called
for loud protestations from the boys. But
after that the rescued dog seemed to want to
show his affection by licking any one of the
boys&rsquo; hands he could find. What better proof
could they have of his gratitude than that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are those horses swimming after
us,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;If we keep on, we&rsquo;ll be like
a traveling circus coming to town, with all
the queer things we rescue. I suppose now the
next job is to gather in all those fowls there,
eh, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to forego that pleasure
just now, Billy. There may be human beings
in need of our coming. I&rsquo;m afraid the chickens
and turkeys will have to take their chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any hungry coons happen along this
way, the chickens won&rsquo;t be apt to die a lingering
death, or one by drowning either. A twist
of the neck would see their finish,&rdquo; said Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way those horses keep swimming
after us, Hugh,&rdquo; protested Tip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they want to be sociable,&rdquo; laughed
Billy, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re leaving them in the lurch
faster now, and soon they&rsquo;ll give it up. When
that happens they&rsquo;ll most likely swim to the
nearest shore, eh, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;No question about it,&rdquo; the pilot assured
him. &ldquo;Horses and cows have some sense
about them. Even on a black night they&rsquo;d
know where the shore lay. It must be what
we call intuition, and which takes the place of
reasoning powers with animals and birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and with frogs and toads, too,&rdquo; said
Billy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve picked up a toad many a time
and thrown him as far out in the lake as I
could; but let me tell you I never yet saw him
strike out; he&rsquo;d head for the shore every time,
swimming for all he was worth, like he thought
a black bass would snap him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time do you think it is?&rdquo; asked
Monkey Stallings from up in the bow where he
was keeping a lookout&mdash;he called it the &ldquo;crow&rsquo;s
nest,&rdquo; because he had read that on board a ship
that is where a man is stationed to sweep the
horizon with his marine glasses from time
to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied Hugh, and as
there was no sun to tell him, he must have
glanced at his watch in order to say it so positively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got two hours or so more of daylight
to work in,&rdquo; Tip remarked. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll
have the time of our lives crawling back home
in the dark, without any of us knowing our
bearings in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t going to be quite that bad,&rdquo;
sang out Monkey. &ldquo;Uncle always keeps plenty
of lights aboard. There&rsquo;s even a reflector that
can be hung up here in the bow. It is one of
those acetylene gas affairs, and makes a dazzling
white light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; cried Billy. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re hard
pushed we can keep up our rescue work into
the night. I&rsquo;d hate to think we&rsquo;d left a single
poor chap to drown when we might exert ourselves
a little extra and save him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, the horses have given us up as a
bad job, and they&rsquo;ve turned toward the land,
you see!&rdquo; announced Tip triumphantly. As he
patted the head of Carlo, the dog pushed up
close alongside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to say, it&rsquo;s raining again,&rdquo; added
Billy. &ldquo;You can see it on the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bad thing all around for those
who are without a shelter,&rdquo; Hugh observed.
&ldquo;Of course it matters very little to us, because
we have a canopy overhead, and curtains if we
want to use them. I&rsquo;m afraid the end is a long
way off still.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;But from now on the rise isn&rsquo;t apt to be so
rapid, you see,&rdquo; Tip continued. &ldquo;It takes a
lot more water to make an inch when it&rsquo;s
spread over such a big lot of territory. Here
are miles and miles covered, and it&rsquo;s the same
way in other low places. Half of the country
up in this region must be afloat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pushing on, they approached what seemed
to be a nest of houses and outbuildings built
for sociability&rsquo;s sake at the adjoining corners
of the farms, so as to make a little community
in the dull winter time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like there are some people left there,
because I saw a signal flutter!&rdquo; announced
Monkey Stallings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unusually low ground around here,&rdquo;
said Tip. &ldquo;I remember the place well, and
they have the finest garden and truck patches
of any about town when things are going on
naturally. But the whole place looks now like
it had been struck by lightning, and then by
a cloudburst. The Williams live in the near
house, and you can see that the water is up
over the top of the lower story. There&rsquo;s some
one on the rooftree waving to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw a white thing moving in that
tree nearby,&rdquo; declared Billy, &ldquo;and if you listen
you&rsquo;ll hear them screeching right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help! we&rsquo;re all drowning! Oh! hurry
and come to save us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tip was seen to be smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I know who that is, all right,&rdquo; he told
the others. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a queer little old woman
at the Williams house, the sassiest and quickest
with her tongue you ever did hear, and they say
she&rsquo;s that set in her ways nobody ever can
make her do a thing she&rsquo;d opposed to. Yes,
that must be Miss Maria screeching, and she&rsquo;s
perched up in that tree, all right, like a guinea
hen. We&rsquo;re going to have a fine time of it getting
<i>her</i> down, let me tell you, if she happens
to be afraid of the limb breaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the launch drew up alongside the
house it was found that three persons had
perched on the ridgepole of the roof, and were
clinging there in great distress of body and
mind. One of them was a brawny farm hand,
another a heavy-set woman, while the third
was a small negro.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>The last immediately slipped down the slope
of the roof and managed to squirm aboard the
boat, as though not meaning to let this fine
chance escape him. It was something of a
task to get the big woman safely down; but
Monkey Stallings volunteered to climb up with
a clothes line and make some sort of a &ldquo;check,&rdquo;
so that with the help of the strong hired man
she was finally successfully taken aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Miss Maria in the tree there?&rdquo; Tip
asked the man, after Hugh had learned that
there were no others about the house needing
assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest who it is,&rdquo; was the answer of the hired
man. &ldquo;She got skeered &rsquo;baout the house right
in the start, an&rsquo; sez it was apt to be kerried
away, which a tree wouldn&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s got
roots. I helped her get up among the branches,
but they hain&rsquo;t be&rsquo;n a minute sense thet she
hain&rsquo;t kept whoopin&rsquo; it up. And haow she&rsquo;s
a-goin&rsquo; to be took daown beats me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The launch was soon under the tree, and
sure enough trouble began immediately. The
little old woman was perched fairly high up,
though even at that she doubtless often imagined
the rising flood was touching her dangling
feet. She declared she was afraid to move so
as to come down. Monkey went up to assist
her, but she continued to cling desperately to
her limb and say she was afraid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>At Hugh&rsquo;s suggestion Monkey even carried
up the rope, and, passing it over a limb above
her head, fastened a loop under her arms.
This was to inspire her with confidence; but
she kept her grip, and gave them all manner
of trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warned you what you&rsquo;d run up against,&rdquo;
chuckled Tip. &ldquo;I know the lady of old. When
she sets her mind it sticks! Serve her right
if we sailed away and left her up there in her
old tree to camp out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Hugh, frowning.
&ldquo;They say that if the mountain won&rsquo;t
come to you, it&rsquo;s up to you to go to the mountain.
We&rsquo;re going to get her down, and that
right away. And, Billy, I&rsquo;m going to leave
that part of the job to you. The rest hang on
to the rope, and keep it taut, so she won&rsquo;t
fall and get hurt. We&rsquo;ll remove her support,
which is the only way. Here, Billy, you&rsquo;re a
good hand with a hatchet; climb up there and
cut that limb close to the tree. Never mind
what she says to you. Some people don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s good for them, and even have to be
saved against their will. Now, up with you,
and get busy, Billy boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">MR. JASPER CHANGES HIS MIND.</span></h2>
<p>Billy Worth entered into the game with his
customary eagerness. There had been so much
of tragedy connected with their experiences
thus far in the rescue of the numerous flood
victims, that what promised to be a rift in the
clouds appealed to him with considerable force.
Billy was always ready for fun.</p>
<p>He saw that Hugh was following the example
of a famous man, Alexander the Great,
who, when offered the Gordian knot to unravel,
simply cut it with his sword. Since so
much remained to be done for others, they
could not afford to waste time with a captious
old woman who, having been hoisted to that
limb, was afraid to let go of it for fear lest
she should be dropped into that terrible waste
of water below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>So Billy took the hatchet and began to climb
the tree. Miss Maria did not at first comprehend
what his intentions were, and even started
scolding the boy for meaning to force her
to put her faith in that slender clothes line.</p>
<p>When he deliberately began to hack away at
the limb upon which she placed her faith, she
realized the impending catastrophe, and shrilly
chided him for what she called his treachery.</p>
<p>Billy kept grimly at work. He was making
splendid progress, for it happened that the boat
hatchet had a keen edge, and Billy had always
prided himself on being something of a woodsman
chopper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold hard below!&rdquo; he called out presently,
at which Miss Maria gave a shriek and
changed her hold from the security of the now
bending limb to the clothes line over her head.</p>
<p>Hugh and the others made sure to have the
rope taut, for they saw that the limb was getting
ready to fall of its own weight, since
Billy had cut more than halfway through it.</p>
<p>Then came a crackling sound, more shrieks
from the little old maid, and she was discovered
dangling in the air, kicking furiously,
and almost wild with fright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Suppressing their desire to laugh, Hugh and
his comrades immediately started to lower her
by slacking up on their end of the rope. When
she came within reach they guided her into the
boat, although in more or less danger of having
their share of knocks from her energetic kicks
into space.</p>
<p>When she found that she had been safely
landed, Miss Maria almost collapsed; but at
least she appeared to be so completely out of
breath that the scouts were spared another
scolding harangue.</p>
<p>The rope recovered, they had no further
reason to remain in that vicinity. When they
could do so without the little old maid&rsquo;s keen
eye being fastened on them, Billy and Tip and
Monkey would exchange grins and suggestive
shrugs; but they were very careful to keep
straight faces if they fancied she were watching
them.</p>
<p>Hugh had mapped out a plan of campaign
when starting up the valley. It was his intention
to cover the inundated territory fully, so
that when they turned back to town they could
feel they had not left any one at the mercy
of the flood who should have been looked after.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>So he kept changing his course in what
might be called a zigzag way, now steering
toward the left shore, and again heading in the
direction of the opposite one. Billy called it
&ldquo;tacking,&rdquo; for their advance up the valley was
by a series of eccentric movements.</p>
<p>Shortly after having rescued Miss Maria in
a manner which she would never recall without
more or less resentment, the scouts discovered
another waving signal that meant trouble.
In this instance it was a farmer who was known
to be well to do, and who had quite a family,
among the rest a couple of boys of twelve and
fourteen.</p>
<p>They had lingered too long at home, from
some cause or other, and were in somewhat of
a panic lest the night come on to find them facing
dreadful hours of darkness and despair.</p>
<p>Hugh was surprised at the lack of smartness
shown by those two lusty lads. He was sure
that if they had belonged to the scouts they
would at least have found some way of constructing
a safety device in the shape of a raft
by means of which the entire family might have
been ferried across the water to the high land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The coming of the launch was the signal for
more or less cheering on the part of these two
boys. They had let their stock loose some time
before, so that it had probably found safety in
the distant hills, swimming the flood.</p>
<p>As they had done on other occasions, Hugh
and his comrades bustled about, and not only
got the farmer and his family aboard but managed
to also save a few bundles of wearing apparel
that the good housewife insisted on taking
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The farmer seems to keep watching us as
if he had something on his mind,&rdquo; was what
Hugh whispered to Tip Lange about the time
they were ready to once more make a start,
intending to land all their passengers the next
time they drew in to the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he has,&rdquo; replied
the Lawrence scout, &ldquo;and I think I can give a
pretty close guess what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you tell me, then?&rdquo; suggested the
patrol leader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, when we started this scout
racket here, his two boys, Tad and Ben Jasper,
were mighty wild to join the troop, but
their dad put his foot down flat against any
such &lsquo;foolishness,&rsquo; as he called it. He seemed
to have the idea in his head, like a lot of other
people do who will not take the trouble to read
the Boy Scout Manual, and learn what the
movement represents, that it was intended just
to make soldiers of all American boys as they
do over in Europe. And no one could ever
get him to listen to reason, though my father
and others tried to show him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kind of suspected it might be that way,&rdquo;
said Hugh, with a smile. &ldquo;That would account
for the helplessness of his boys when they
found themselves up against a situation like
this. Scouts would have had that family
ashore hours ago. They have never learned
to think for themselves. I hope it&rsquo;s going to
prove a grand lesson for Mr. Jasper; and let
me make a prediction, Tip, which is that inside
of two weeks you&rsquo;ll be enrolling the names of
Tad and Ben Jasper on your roster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, when they were approaching
the land, Mr. Jasper, looking as though he had
something on his mind that would give him
no peace until he had it out, opened the conversation
by remarking:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the sort of thing you scouts learn
to do, Tipton Lange? Because, if it teaches
boys to be self-reliant and brave and obliging,
I&rsquo;m going to look deeper into the scheme. I
realize now that there&rsquo;s something lacking
about my lads. They should have been able
to do something to get us out of this scrape.
And if being Boy Scouts will build them up so
they can take the bit in their teeth and go
ahead when a necessity comes along, why, I
want to know all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that, sir,&rdquo; declared
Tip, flushing with pleasure, while Tad
and Ben pushed nearer, their faces displaying
an eagerness they could not disguise. &ldquo;And
my father will be pleased to have you call on
him to hear what he has to say about the scout
movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him about the bridge affair, Tip!&rdquo; suggested
Billy, although Hugh made a movement
with his hand, and frowned as though he did
not like the idea of being forced to hear himself
praised.</p>
<p>Tip, however, was only too willing. The
time did not allow of any elaborate yarn spinning,
but in a brief recital he explained to Mr.
Jasper the difference between sheer recklessness
and true bravery as exhibited by the actions
of Tug Wilson and Hugh Hardin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Mr. Jasper insisted on shaking the patrol
leader&rsquo;s hand after Tip had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is what it does for boys,&rdquo; he said
heartily, &ldquo;then my sons shall join a troop at the
first opportunity. I don&rsquo;t want them to grow
up with the idea of being soldiers and fighting
just for the love of war; but like every father
I do hope they will always be brave and self-reliant.
Yes, I shall certainly look into this
thing. It has been a lesson to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jasper,&rdquo; said Billy, unable to keep from
getting a few &ldquo;licks&rdquo; in while he had the
chance, &ldquo;if you were in Lawrence at this very
minute you would find more than a dozen
scouts in khaki working like beavers with boats
and rafts, the last made by themselves, saving
stranded people, and trying to salvage some of
their possessions before the flood took their
houses, for where the current is swift it carries
buildings away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is true, son,&rdquo; said the wealthy old
farmer, &ldquo;then the future of the Boy Scout
movement in Lawrence is assured, depend on
that. I&rsquo;ve been heading the opposition, but
now that my eyes have been opened I&rsquo;ll be just
as hard a worker in its favor, you can depend
on that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Billy, waving his hat, as
did also Monkey Stallings and Tip, but Hugh
was too busy making a landing just then to
take his eyes off the shore, or his hands off the
wheel.</p>
<p>So they put their human freight, together
with Carlo, the big dog, ashore, although the
latter did not seem to want to leave his new
friends. The Jasper boys wore broad smiles,
and no one would ever have suspected that for
the time being they were castaways and fugitives
from their destroyed home. The fact of
the matter was that they had begun to look
upon all this privation as a means to an end.
Boys always do have a weakness for any Crusoe
sort of business; and what they had heard
their father say concerning his change of views
had filled their hearts with a new joy that could
not be crushed just because they were temporary
exiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two more turns across ought to finish
our patrol duty,&rdquo; said Hugh, as the boat again
started out upon the wide stretch of dismal
waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we might get back to town in time to
be of some more use there before the night
settles down,&rdquo; proposed Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That light rain has stopped, for one thing,&rdquo;
remarked Monkey Stallings, trying to discover
some loophole of encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hope it doesn&rsquo;t start in again,&rdquo; said
Billy quickly. &ldquo;The weather sharps were away
off their base when they said another storm
was headed in our direction. Well, I wondered
what that was coming this way, but now
I can see it&rsquo;s some sort of big animal swimming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cow it seems like to me,&rdquo; ventured Tip
Lange. &ldquo;Yet it&rsquo;s got a big head and gilt balls
on its horns. Must be that prize bull Mr. Jasper
owns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve hit it that time,&rdquo; Monkey
told him. &ldquo;I reckon the beast may have been
trying to stand on some knoll that was higher
than the surrounding land, and finally had to
swim for it. Look at him making straight for
the boat, will you? I&rsquo;ve heard that when
frightened domestic animals will turn to human
company for help, and it seems like that is
so. Hey! what ails the engine, Hugh?&rdquo; for
the launch had suddenly ceased to keep moving
ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to fix something, and there&rsquo;s no
getting around it,&rdquo; replied the patrol leader.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t risk the danger of an explosion.
Five or ten minutes ought to be enough time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that bull looks like he meant to come
aboard here!&rdquo; ejaculated Monkey, as the swimming
beast drew near, with his head breaking
through the surface of the water, part of his
broad back showing, and his long tail streaming
in the rear after the manner of a rudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the hook!&rdquo; shouted Billy, suiting the
action to the word by snatching up the push
pole, with which he stood on guard. &ldquo;Here,
you, keep off! We&rsquo;re not in the beef-packing
line just now. Head for the shore, and put in
your best licks. Why didn&rsquo;t you keep company
with the rest of your herd, instead of loafing
out here? No, you don&rsquo;t, old boy! We
couldn&rsquo;t think of letting you get your hoofs
over our rail; you&rsquo;d sink us in a hurry. Shout
at him, everybody, and shoo him off before he
upsets the launch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">A DARING RESCUE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes, and a good riddance!&rdquo; announced
Tip Lange, as after having been prodded
and shouted at vigorously, the swimming
animal doubtless came to the conclusion that
he was not wanted, and began to make a
straight line for the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He manages to get along all right for one
of his heft, I take it,&rdquo; asserted Billy reflectively.
&ldquo;Which goes to show that because a fellow
is stout it&rsquo;s no reason he should be reckoned
clumsy, nor yet slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This doubtless was a matter of more or less
satisfaction to Billy, because he had often
been &ldquo;joshed&rdquo; by his chums on account of his
increasing waistline.</p>
<p>They crossed over and back without discovering
another case of &ldquo;help wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if we had cleaned things up pretty
tidily around here,&rdquo; observed Tip Lange,
with a touch of pride in his manner, &ldquo;unless
we choose to start in moving families&rsquo; belongings
from their flooded houses. And as that
would be too big an undertaking for us to go
into, I guess we don&rsquo;t care to make a beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way now, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Billy.
&ldquo;Can we head back to town? I&rsquo;m wondering
how the other fellows are coming along with
their share of the work, and whether we could
help them out in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m going to make for the outlet of
the valley,&rdquo; the pilot told him. &ldquo;We could run
up in the rear of the town, but it&rsquo;s better to
go back as we came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a good thing we can get out of this
mess before night sets in,&rdquo; Monkey remarked
over his shoulder, for he was sprawled like a
big toad in the bow, so that he might keep a
lookout for any snags in their course, Hugh
having delegated him for that duty.</p>
<p>There was very little movement to the water
in the flooded valley, except as the wind happened
to blow, and just then it was almost
calm. So the launch went cheerily on its way,
as though with every <i>rat-tat-tat</i> explosion it
rejoiced over the fact of having been instrumental
in saving so many persons from all
sorts of suffering, both mental and physical.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Tip Lange seemed to be feeling especially
fine. This was doubtless caused by the fact
that things were working for the revival of
the scout movement in Lawrence. He had
been hearing some pretty handsome compliments
of late from the mayor, and then Mr.
Jasper, once the most disliked man in all Lawrence
among scout circles on account of his
well-known animosity toward the movement.</p>
<p>How wonderfully had the atmosphere been
cleared, and all because of the magnificent opportunity
that had come along whereby the
wearers of the much-abused khaki were given
a chance to show what they were good for!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about blessings in disguise,&rdquo; Tip had
to say, as he sat near Hugh and watched the
other tinkering with the working motor, trying
to improve its action by slight changes,
&ldquo;this flood may mean a whole lot of trouble to
lots of folks, but it&rsquo;s going to be the making
of Lawrence Troop, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your worst enemy now is a booster,&rdquo;
replied Hugh, smiling to see how the great
change in the conditions was affecting Tip,
who seemed to be smiling most all the time
now. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to see that you&rsquo;re going to
have smooth sailing here. Put your shoulder
to the wheel, Tip, and never again allow yourself
to give up to despair. Try and believe
the sun is shining back of the clouds, and that
it&rsquo;s always darkest just before dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dawn has come for us, I reckon, Hugh, and
we owe the most of it to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I don&rsquo;t want to listen to any talk
like that, Tip. At least keep it until I&rsquo;m back
home in Oakvale. Then if you fellows here
think I can give you any good advice, or help
you to build up your troop, write me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear from us, never fear,&rdquo; said the
other significantly, as though even then he had
some vague idea in his mind as to the way in
which he and his brother scouts of Lawrence
Troop ought to suitably thank these two
strangers for all they had done toward starting
the ball rolling again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re close to the river, Hugh!&rdquo; sang out
Monkey Stallings, &ldquo;and, gee whiz! how it does
seem to be booming along out there! Some
current, that, let me tell you. Do you think we
could work up against it if we had to, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I reckon we could,&rdquo; the pilot replied
carelessly, &ldquo;though it&rsquo;d be slow work, and if
the engine took a notion to give out we&rsquo;d have
to get our anchor overboard in a hurry to hold
fast. But so far as we know there&rsquo;s no need
of our trying such a risky thing as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, look there, boys, isn&rsquo;t that a house
floating along, and bobbing up and down like a
cork? Now she turns one way and then another.
Some poor family has lost their home
up above. It&rsquo;s too bad, and I only hope they
all managed to get safe to the hills before the
cabin went. Oh! what&rsquo;s that clinging to the
roof? Seems to me it moved then! Yes, as
sure as anything it&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the scout in the bow made this loud outcry,
the others all strained their eyes to see.
Even Hugh diverted his attention from the
steering gear and the working motor to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy!&rdquo; declared Tip Lange, almost immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the poor fellow looks like he would
soon be tumbled into the river when that cabin
takes a notion to turn all the way over!&rdquo; added
Billy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what can we do?&rdquo; cried Monkey, his
voice filled with pity. &ldquo;Hugh, would you dare
chase after that floating house and try to rescue
the poor chap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh had to think quickly when the question
was put up to him in that way. Naturally
his first impulse would be to say &ldquo;go,&rdquo; because
he felt keenly for the desperate situation of
that boy who dared not leave his floating refuge.
It might be because he could not swim,
and that raging torrent was enough to give
the best swimmer reason for holding back.
Still, Hugh had also to remember that it would
be risking four lives for one if he decided to
make the try.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll save him if we can,&rdquo; he said finally,
after looking everything in the face. &ldquo;If the
current is too swift to let us get back again
to-night, why what&rsquo;s to hinder our tying up
to the bank and waiting? There&rsquo;ll be another
day coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and scouts ought to know how to rustle
for grub at some house they&rsquo;d find ashore,&rdquo;
added Billy, who, it may be remembered, was
especially fond of hearing the dinner bell ring,
or catching some other camp summons that
told of a waiting meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Full speed ahead!&rdquo; sang out Monkey, evidently
entering into the spirit of the occasion
with his customary zeal.</p>
<p>The floating cabin had a pretty good start
of them, Hugh knew, but once the launch had
reached the river, and turned down, they must
speedily overcome this lead. He had no fears
about not being able to overtake the runaway
cabin, though when they presently started with
the speeding current their progress was so
swift that it almost made one dizzy to watch
the shore line, so rapidly did it seem to glide
past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re catching up hand over fist!&rdquo; announced
Monkey enthusiastically, from his post
in the bow; but he no longer held this alone,
since both Tip and Billy were crowded in
alongside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s still hanging on!&rdquo; announced the
Lawrence scout. &ldquo;Good for him, whoever the
little chap is. I like his grit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I kind of guess he can&rsquo;t do much
else but hang on with all his might,&rdquo; commented
Billy. &ldquo;There, didn&rsquo;t you see him wave his
hand at us then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s discovered us, all right,&rdquo; observed
Monkey, &ldquo;and like as not it gives him a new
lot of strength to know we&rsquo;re heading after
him, poor kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to watch out for snags,&rdquo;
warned Hugh, &ldquo;because going at this rate, if
we ever banged into a log, it would be all up
with the launch. And perhaps we&rsquo;d be glad
to climb up on that cabin roof with the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! I hope we don&rsquo;t come to that yet
a while, Hugh!&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m keeping
a bright lookout for any floaters all the time.
It isn&rsquo;t near as bad as if we were breasting the
current, you know. Then they&rsquo;d hit us a savage
smash, while now we&rsquo;re all going the same
way, only we&rsquo;re beating everything else out
of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy, seeing the imperiled boy once more
waving his hand, took it upon himself to give
him a return salute with his campaign hat. At
the same time he let out a vigorous shout in
hopes of cheering the poor castaway.</p>
<p>Already they had gone a mile or so below
the flooded town, but they were rapidly overhauling
the floating cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him, don&rsquo;t you fear,&rdquo; Billy was
saying, half to himself, as though he may have
been doubtful up to then. &ldquo;That cabin is going
to behave, and not act like a bucking broncho
to toss him off, even if it does lurch and
bog something scandalous. Give him a cheer,
boys, to hearten him more. Now, altogether!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they ran down alongside the cabin. They
had discovered some time back that their conclusion
about its being a half-grown boy who
was clinging to the roof of the floating house
was correct. He looked peaked and white,
indeed, though it could be seen that he was
beginning to pluck up new courage as he saw
them drawing ever nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ll we get him aboard without running
too much risk, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First get your rope ready,&rdquo; the pilot told
him. &ldquo;Have a loop in the end just as you did
for Miss Maria. Then when I pull alongside
throw it up to him. Once he gets that loop
under his arms, and we can be sure of drawing
him aboard even if he happened to make a slip
and fall overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;I like the scheme, Hugh,&rdquo; was the only
comment Billy made as he hurriedly took up
the accommodating clothes line, at the end of
which he found the same running noose that
had played such a prominent part in the saving
of the little old maid who had persisted in clinging
to her perch in the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I can fling it all right, even if the
room isn&rsquo;t all I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; Billy remarked as he
arranged the coils the way he had seen some
Western cowboys do many a time in a Wild
West show. &ldquo;Please back off, Tip, and get
on my other side. And, Monkey, hold the push
pole out of the way when you hold off from the
cabin. All ready here, Hugh. Bring her
closer, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was calculating the distance. He
wanted to succeed in their present undertaking
because that boy&rsquo;s life was just as valuable as
any other they had saved during the momentous
day. At the same time Hugh did not wish
to make any blunder apt to cost them dear.</p>
<p>Billy saw his chance, and giving the necessary
toss sent the coils of rope across the roof
of the teetering cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get hold of that rope, and slip the loop under
your arms!&rdquo; he called out as loud as he
could, for the water was making a lot of noise
as it swirled about the cabin and the launch,
forming fierce eddies and little whirlpools.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>The boy was not so badly frightened now.
He could do what he was told, they saw with
considerable relief. Had it been otherwise one
of the rescuing party, perhaps the agile Monkey
Stallings, would have been compelled to
clamber up to the roof and have accomplished
the dangerous work in that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, pull the noose tight!&rdquo; continued
Billy, when he saw the boy had followed out
his command. &ldquo;Make your way toward this
end of the roof, and be ready to jump when I
say so. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of falling in; we&rsquo;ve
got the rope tight, and can yank you out of
the river as quick as a flash if you should miss.
Steady now, and it&rsquo;s going to be as easy as
falling off a log.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this fashion, then, did Billy coax the boy
to crawl along the reeling roof of the cabin
until he had reached the edge. Then, when
the right second came, and the building was
inclined toward them, he suddenly called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump, boy, jump!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>The lad had faith enough to believe what
Billy so confidently told him. He sprang without
hesitation, struck the edge of the launch,
and then several eager hands seized upon him
before he could fall back into the water.</p>
<p>And as Hugh backed away from the tumbling
cabin he joined his chums in letting out
a loud shout that relieved their pent-up feelings
as nothing else could have done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">WELL-EARNED PRAISE.</span></h2>
<p>It was just as Hugh had expected.</p>
<p>The launch was turned so that her head
pointed upstream again, but out there, in the
middle of the river, the current proved to be
so strong that, although the motor worked
madly, they gained very little headway. Even
when Hugh crept in closer to the shore, where
they might have a better chance to proceed, he
realized that it was hopeless trying to get back
to town under several hours.</p>
<p>As the night was now ready to close in upon
them, the danger of meeting with an accident
warned the careful pilot against attempting
anything like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on the lookout for a good tying-up
place, boys,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;If you see a tree
close to the water, and what looks like a little
cove below it, that&rsquo;s the spot we want to
stop at.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;And let&rsquo;s hope,&rdquo; added Billy, sighing, &ldquo;that
there&rsquo;ll be a hospitable farmer, or some sort
of kind-hearted man with a house up on the
hillside where we can beg a bite to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are all sorts of pots and pans and
kitchen things aboard,&rdquo; Monkey told them, &ldquo;if
only we can lay hold of anything to cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; remarked Billy loftily,
determination written on his face.</p>
<p>The landing was effected without any particular
trouble, and with the cable they tied
the launch up to the friendly tree, as well as
made the boat fast astern.</p>
<p>Billy hardly waited for this to be done before
he was off. Evidently he had discovered that
they were close to the river road, at this point
well elevated. Tip had told him that people
lived here and there all along this thoroughfare,
although very likely they could not get
anywhere now, with the water so high, for in
places the road must be covered ten feet or
more with the flood.</p>
<p>The night began to creep around them, but
there was no rain, for which all of them
thought they had reason to be thankful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Upon questioning the boy who had been
taken off the floating cabin, Hugh learned just
how it happened that he came there. He had
been away from home when his folks must
have fled because of the rising water. Coming
back later he had not known what to do,
but remained cowering in the home until the
rising water caused him to take to the roof.
And later on, when the current started the
cabin downstream, there he was helpless, because
he did not know the first thing about
swimming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have known that at any rate if you&rsquo;d
been a scout,&rdquo; Hugh told him, always ready
to plant the seed broadcast, &ldquo;though that
mightn&rsquo;t have helped you much. It was lucky
you stuck to the cabin. We&rsquo;ll see that you get
back with your folks all right, Tommy, never
fear. I&rsquo;m only wondering what your mother
will be thinking when she misses you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes Billy!&rdquo; cried Monkey Stallings,
excitedly. &ldquo;Say, he looks as if he might
be just loaded down with stuff. Chances are
he found a deserted house, and made a raid on
the pantry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ve got another guess coming,&rdquo;
said Billy Worth, as he started to relieve
himself of his numerous packages. &ldquo;By the
greatest good luck in the wide world I hit on
the house of a gentleman named Judge Coffin.
Seems that he&rsquo;s been one of your best backers,
Tip, here in Lawrence. When he heard what
the scouts had been doing he told me the
house was mine, and that I could have anything
I wanted. Fact is, he loaded me down
with good things; and he&rsquo;s coming over here
to eat dinner with us in an hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tip threw up his hat and crowed as though
he might be an exultant barnyard rooster that
had just whipped his worst enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what luck!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Everything
seems to be coming my way. I think you
Oakvale fellows must have brought it along
with you. &lsquo;It never rains but it pours,&rsquo; and I
don&rsquo;t care if I haven&rsquo;t any umbrella either.
Let&rsquo;s get busy and give the judge the best
camp supper he ever heard about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do that, too, Tip,&rdquo; intimated Monkey.
&ldquo;This fellow Billy Worth has all the
French <i>chefs</i> beat to a frazzle when he gets
to slinging the pots and pans around. You&rsquo;ll
think so after you get a whiff of his cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a whole lot taffy, and don&rsquo;t you take
any stock in it, Tip,&rdquo; protested the said Billy.
&ldquo;Course I like to cook some, and, if I do say
it myself, I know how to do a few plain things
fairly decent. But we&rsquo;ll all lend a hand. Here,
Monkey, you start the ball rolling by peeling
these potatoes, while I look after the fire
aboard the boat, for everything is soaked out
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owner of the launch must have delighted
to take little excursions on his boat, for he
had everything on board that would be needed
for getting up a meal, even to a three-burner
blue-flame kerosene stove that worked splendidly,
Billy soon discovered.</p>
<p>In spite of all they had gone through, the
boys entered into the duty of getting up that
supper with the greatest of vim. And when
later on an elderly gentleman, whom Tip introduced
to them as Judge Coffin, made his appearance,
he found the meal ready to be served.</p>
<p>He was a man whose heart had always remained
fresh, and who loved boys, although
his twin sons had been cruelly taken from him
years before through an accident, simply because
no one with them had known the first
thing about reviving a person who had been in
the water until he seemed to be drowned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Judge Coffin firmly believed that had the
comrades of his boys been posted as all scouts
of to-day are on these important methods of
resuscitation, one or both of his precious twins
might have been spared to him. And that was
the secret of his belief in the scout movement
as a means of saving life.</p>
<p>There on board the launch, and while enjoying
such a supper as he had not sat down to
for many years, no doubt&mdash;primitive though
the table and the tin dishes may have been&mdash;he
listened while the scouts modestly told what
a great day they had had.</p>
<p>And, reading between the lines, that astute
lawyer could easily understand how the coming
of Hugh Hardin to Lawrence just when
the breaking down of the railroad embankment
brought about his enforced stay there had been
the main cause for all this service on the part
of the local scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>How his eyes shone as he looked fondly at
the boy who had dashed upon the imperiled
bridge and saved the reckless bully, Tug Wilson,
as Tip persisted in telling the story, despite
Hugh&rsquo;s remonstrance and embarrassed
manner. No doubt Judge Coffin was saying,
deep down in his heart, that had his boys only
lived he could not wish anything grander for
either of them than that they might take pattern
after this brave yet modest scout from
Oakvale.</p>
<p>Long he lingered&mdash;indeed, it seemed hard
work for the worthy gentleman to tear himself
away from the company of those four gallant
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, Tipton,&rdquo; he said, as he shook
the hand of each after bidding them &ldquo;good-night&rdquo;
for the third time, &ldquo;there are bright
days ahead for you and your comrades of Lawrence
Troop. When such a scout hater as
Neighbor Jasper has had the scales lifted from
his eyes, all opposition is bound to cease. A
reaction is going to set in, and you&rsquo;ll have
more recruits applying for admission to your
ranks than you can well take care of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the scouts voted the judge one of the
finest men they had ever met. He seemed to
have a faculty for entering into the inmost recesses
of a boy&rsquo;s heart, and finding lodgment
there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;How are we going to manage for to-night?&rdquo;
asked Tip Lange, some time after the
judge had taken his departure, and they began
to feel more or less sleepy.</p>
<p>It turned out that the Lawrence scout had
had very little experience in camping. He and
his comrades of the local troop had met with
so many backsets in their efforts to build up
an enduring organization that their outings
had been few and unhappy.</p>
<p>Hugh had been thinking this over himself,
and now expressed his views.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we might manage to sleep aboard
the launch, though it would be a tight squeeze
for us all. Two might do it comfortably, and
the others camp ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to hinder all of us spending the
night here on the bank?&rdquo; asked Tip; &ldquo;I know
I&rsquo;d enjoy it a whole lot better than being
cooped up on the old launch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sentiments exactly,&rdquo; declared Billy;
&ldquo;and to tell you the truth I&rsquo;m getting so sleepy
right now I hardly care where I drop down, so
long as I&rsquo;m let alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you, Monkey?&rdquo; demanded
Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all I need is a tree with a decent limb
to the same! You know I&rsquo;m something like
a bat or a &rsquo;possum, and I c&rsquo;n hang head-down
from a branch without any bother. Count me
in any game you&rsquo;ve got on the calendar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s settled, then,&rdquo; asserted Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some blankets and robes in the
lockers of the boat, you know,&rdquo; suggested
Billy, as he scrambled to his feet to stretch
himself before starting aboard the launch
again.</p>
<p>When a thorough search had been made it
was found that there were plenty of covers for
the entire quartet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better if we&rsquo;d planned for this
little camping trip,&rdquo; remarked Monkey, as he
began to look around for a good place in which
to make up his bed, such as it was going to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The song of the flooded river will be a regular
lullaby,&rdquo; suggested Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be to you fellows,&rdquo; observed Tip;
&ldquo;but I own up that I&rsquo;m not used to going to
sleep in the open, and it&rsquo;s likely to keep me
awake. If I do manage to drop off, the chances
are I&rsquo;ll dream of poor people hanging to the
roofs of houses that are floating down the
river and falling to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can stand it for one night, though,
Tip,&rdquo; Billy told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s going to be an experience for
you worth having,&rdquo; Monkey told him. &ldquo;When
you meet your chums again you can crow over
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; admitted Tip, as he watched
closely to see how the others fixed their blankets,
so that he could imitate them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One good thing,&rdquo; remarked Billy, after another
tremendous yawn, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t like being
up in the wild woods where a bear or a panther
might take a notion to drop in on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh knew that Billy was saying this to get
an opinion from some of the others. Perhaps
he was feeling a trifle uneasy over sleeping
there in the open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any danger of our
camp being invaded by an animal more dangerous
than a wandering cow that might have
got lost in all the excitement,&rdquo; Hugh assured
him.</p>
<p>Billy seemed to be satisfied with that convincing
statement, for presently he crawled under
his blanket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, fellows!&rdquo; he said in a thick
voice as if already half asleep.</p>
<p>Tip looked as though he really envied Billy
his indifference. Just as he had said it would
very likely prove a difficult task for the new
camper to lose himself in slumber.</p>
<p>Hugh waited until all the others had apparently
settled down. There was the fire to
look after, for with so much dampness in the
air he did not think it advisable to let it go out
entirely.</p>
<p>That was where his long experience in camping
would prove valuable, for Hugh knew just
how to arrange the fire so that it would burn
for hours at a stretch without needing replenishing.</p>
<p>Finally he, too, crawled under his coverings
and settled down as best he could to get some
sleep, of which they were all in such need.</p>
<p>They had had a pretty lively day of it considering,
and it was little wonder Hugh felt
more or less tired.</p>
<p>The noisy flood might continue to boom and
gurgle as it rushed along near by, but that
would not keep the patrol leader from slumber.
Many times in the past he had experienced
worse conditions and refused to be kept awake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>The last thing he remembered noticing was
the crackling fire sending its red tongues upward
as it seized upon the fresh fuel.</p>
<p>Hugh awoke with a start, and no wonder.
Someone was calling aloud, and the burden of
his cries were of a nature to cause alarm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh! oh! Hugh, wake up! There&rsquo;s something
raiding our camp! It tried to carry me
off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was Billy whooping it up, as Hugh discovered
when he rolled out of his blanket.</p>
<p>Monkey Stallings was already on his feet,
being a wonderfully agile chap. He had looked
around in his quick fashion, and not discovering
any terrible tiger or other beast of prey in
sight, naturally turned on the disturber of his
peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone and got the nightmare, that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s the matter, Billy Worth!&rdquo; he told the
other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice state of affairs when a fellow
can&rsquo;t get his sleep out. I knew you&rsquo;d pay
for eating so much supper. You just dreamed
it all. I&rsquo;d like to see what&rsquo;d try to carry <i>you</i>
off!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Billy, however, was firmly convinced that it
had not been a dream but a positive reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I ought to know,&rdquo; he declared;
&ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I feel it lifting me up, and growling
like everything in the bargain? First I was
scared so I seemed to be turned into ice. Then
I let out that first whoop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then it ran away, did it?&rdquo; sneered the
unbelieving Monkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it did,&rdquo; asserted Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see it, Billy?&rdquo; asked Hugh, determined
to sift this midnight alarm to the bottom
while about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Hugh,&rdquo; Billy went on to say, &ldquo;I had
a little trouble getting my cover away from
my face, for I&rsquo;d snuggled down in the same
to keep my head warm. But as sure as I&rsquo;m
standing here, Hugh, I saw the bushes moving
over there, like some terrible animal had gone
that way. Let&rsquo;s throw some stones and scare
him off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need of that,&rdquo; said Hugh, with a
chuckle, as he picked up a club and then started
directly toward the quarter pointed out by
Billy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take care, Hugh, or he might get you!&rdquo;
warned Monkey, at the same time casting
about for the duplicate of the cudgel the patrol
leader had taken as a weapon of defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoo!&rdquo; cried Hugh, waving his arms vigorously
as he approached the bushes.</p>
<p>As though that cry and the accompanying
movement had broken the spell of silence there
came a whole chorus of grunts both big and little.
There was also a great scurrying of feet,
together with squeals that could have but one
meaning to the scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pigs!&rdquo; gasped Billy, as a mother sow followed
by half a dozen little porkers started off
in a panic, rushing pell-mell away, and followed
by the mocking shouts of Monkey Stallings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your tiger, is it, Billy?&rdquo; he demanded
as he prepared to once more crawl
into his coverings; &ldquo;Well, you certainly have
got the liveliest imagination of any fellow I
ever met. The idea of taking a poor old
mother hog with her litter of suckling pigs for
a monster trying to carry you off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she did root under my blanket, I tell
you,&rdquo; Billy insisted; &ldquo;and being waked up so
suddenly, how could I tell the difference between
a grunt and a growl? I only hope she
stays away the rest of the night and lets a poor
tired scout get his regular sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently it would require much more than
an occurrence of this sort to keep Billy wakeful.
Inside of ten minutes Hugh could hear
his regular breathing, from which he concluded
the other was again off to the land of dreams.</p>
<p>The balance of the night passed without any
further alarm. Perhaps Tip did not secure
much sleep, and was the happiest fellow in the
party to see the gray dawn coming in the east.
Still, it had been a great experience for Tip,
and one he would not soon forget.</p>
<p>All of the boys were soon up and doing.
While two of them saw to it that the blankets
and other coverings were returned to the
launch, the others looked after the preparations
for their morning meal which, thanks to
the generous judge, would not be as primitive
as it might have been.</p>
<p>After they had eaten breakfast, the start was
made up the current. Monkey had been smart
enough to fix some sort of tally so as to know
how high the river rose while they slept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just seven inches, fellows,&rdquo; he had announced
the first thing; and then, as the expedition
was about to leave their moorings,
Monkey declared with considerable delight:
&ldquo;Would you believe it, the water is actually
<i>going down</i>! Sure it is, for here you can see
where the stick is wet for an inch above the
level!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; cried Tip. &ldquo;Things will soon be
on the mend, and poor old Lawrence will get
back to looking like it was before the flood, all
but our bridge, which is gone where the woodbine
twineth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that,&rdquo; said Billy, &ldquo;so
long as none of your folks went downstream
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found it slow work breasting the current,
but then, as a rift appeared in the leaden
clouds overhead, everyone was soon feeling
greatly encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the judge waving to us!&rdquo; said Tip,
and of course everyone hastened to reply to
the salutation from the high ground back of
which the home of their good friend lay, safe
from danger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>All through that day the scouts found plenty
to do with the launch. And many a mother
and father had reason to thank them warmly
for attentions received that were doubly welcome
in such a time of stress.</p>
<p>Hugh kept his word and saw to it that Tommy
was safely returned to his family, thus relieving
the fears of the father and mother, who
had begun to believe the little fellow had been
drowned.</p>
<p>As there still seemed to be no way of getting
back home unless they went by a&euml;roplane,
Hugh and Billy and Monkey had to remain
over for another day or so, nor did they feel
sorry that this happened. Monkey had interested
his uncle in his two chums so that nothing
would do but they must be his guests while in
town. Tip Lange felt somewhat disappointed
for he had hoped to coax them to go home with
him.</p>
<p>But on the second day word came that the
repairs had progressed so far with the washed
portions of the railroad embankment that a
train would pass through Lawrence early that
afternoon bound east.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>It was at the station, as our three young
friends, together with Tip Lange, Wash Bradford,
Teddy McQuade, and Wallie Cramer,
were waiting for the train to appear that quite
a crowd of older people, as well as all the rest
of the Boy Scouts in town surprised them. At
the head of the delegation was the worthy
Mayor of Lawrence. When Hugh saw them
coming he began to show signs of uneasiness;
but there was no place to which he could retreat,
nor would the other fellows allow it.</p>
<p>And so he had to stand there and listen to
as neat a flood of oratory as could be imagined,
as the Mayor told him, and his two chums in
the bargain, that they carried away from
Lawrence the best wishes of all those who
dwelt there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your visit was in the nature of an inspiration,&rdquo;
the Mayor wound up with. &ldquo;It has certainly
put new life into our local troop of
scouts. We owe you more than mere words
can tell, and in leaving us we want you to know
that you will never be forgotten. Your noble
work here in the time of our tribulation will
always stand as a living example of what Boy
Scouts can accomplish when their hearts are
in the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Fortunately the coming of the train allowed
Hugh to escape without making a reply to this
flood of praise that came straight from the
heart of the speaker. And the last they saw
of the Lawrence scouts they were lined up and
giving their comrades from Oakvale the grand
salute, with Tip Lange at their head.</p>
<p>Later on Hugh heard from the boys, and
was delighted to know that the troop was flourishing
like a green bay tree. There arrived at
Hugh&rsquo;s home a loving cup purchased by donations
from scores of Lawrence citizens, and
which was accompanied by a letter which might
well cause the recipients to feel proud they had
been given an opportunity to be of service to
the victims of the Great Flood.</p>
<p>If you want to know what undertaking next
employed the attention of these wide-awake
Oakvale lads, read the succeeding volume, entitled:
